    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The first Nowell the angel did say,<br/>Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;<br/>In fields where they lay keeping their sheep,<br/>On a cold winter's night that was so deep.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Nowell, Nowell, Nowell, Nowell,<br/>Born is the King of Israel.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>They looked up and saw a star,<br/>Shining in the East, beyond them far,<br/>And to the earth it gave great light,<br/>And so it continued both day and night.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>And by the light of that same star,<br/>Three wise men came from country far;<br/>To seek for a King was their intent<br/>And to follow the star wherever it went.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>This star drew nigh to the north-west<br/>O'er Bethlehem it took its rest,<br/>And there it did both stop and stay,<br/>Right over the place where Jesus lay.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Then entered in those wise men three<br/>Full reverently on bended knee,<br/>And offered there, in His presence<br/>Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>Then let us all with one accord<br/>Sing praises to our heavenly Lord<br/>That hath made heaven and earth of nought<br/>And with His blood mankind hath bought.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
