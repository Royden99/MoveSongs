    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There is no glory in my own wisdom,<br/>There  is no power in my own strength, there is no might <br/>In my own riches, but I will boast in knowing you.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>For You are high and lifted up, the glory of the nations<br/>You are high and lifted up, Lord of all the earth.<br/>You are high and lifted up,  Creator, Redeemer, <br/>For I will boast in knowing You.</lines>
