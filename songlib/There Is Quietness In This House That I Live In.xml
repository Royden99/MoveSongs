    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There is quietness in this house that I live in.<br/>There is peace in this house that I live in.<br/>There's much love in this house that I live in.<br/>Only God can create such a house.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>There is joy for each one who lives here.<br/>There is peace, there is love enough for all.<br/>And we have the love of Jesus in our brother.<br/>God redeemed us through Christ from the fall.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There is wisdom in this house that we live in.<br/>There is counsel for each one to keep the way.<br/>And we all flow together in the Body,<br/>In this house that we live in today.</lines>
