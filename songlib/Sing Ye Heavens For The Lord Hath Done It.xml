    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Sing, ye heavens, for the Lord has done it,<br/>Shout, ye lower parts of the earth,<br/>Break into song, ye seed of Abraham and God;<br/>For the abased and despised of the world<br/>Hath God chosen and quickened from the dead,<br/>Calling those things which be not as though they were.<br/>To bring to nought the wisdom of this world,<br/>And to confound those things that are mighty;<br/>The foolishness of God is wiser than all men,<br/>The weakness of God is stronger than death,<br/>Yes, amen, amen, amen, amen!<br/></lines>
