    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Jesus is changing me, Jesus is changing me,<br/>The work of the refiner's fire;<br/>To be as pure gold in the house of the Lord,<br/>To bring right offerings to Him.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>To Him I give all my love and praise,<br/>With joy I draw near to Him;<br/>The Son of Righteousness rises over me,<br/>With healing in His wings.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Then shall the blessing of the Lord come down,<br/>When we give all to Him,<br/>And we shall go forth in holiness,<br/>Delighting ourselves in God.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
