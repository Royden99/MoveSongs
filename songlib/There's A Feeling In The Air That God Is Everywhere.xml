    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There's a feeling in the air that God is everywhere,<br/>And His resurrection power is moving in this hour<br/>That Jesus might be glorified.          (x2)<br/>I will glorify the name of the Lord;<br/>I will glorify His name.<br/>And His resurrection power is moving in this hour,<br/>That Jesus might be glorified.<br/></lines>
