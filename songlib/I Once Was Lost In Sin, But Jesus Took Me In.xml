    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I once was lost in sin, but Jesus took me in <br/>And then a little light from heaven filled my soul <br/>It bathed my heart in love and wrote my name above<br/>And just a little talk with Jesus made me whole.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Now let us have a little talk with Jesus<br/>Let us tell Him all about our troubles<br/>He will hear our faintest cry<br/>And He will answer by and by.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Now when you feel a little prayer wheel turning<br/>And you know a little fire is burning<br/>You will find a little talk with Jesus makes it right.</lines>
