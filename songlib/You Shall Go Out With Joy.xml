      <lines>You shall go out with joy<br/>And be lead forth with peace,<br/>And the mountains and the hills<br/>Shall break forth before you,<br/>There'll be shouts of joy,<br/>And the trees of the field shall clap their hands<br/>Shall clap, shall clap their hands,<br/>And the trees of the field shall clap their hands,<br/>The trees of the field shall clap their hands,<br/>The trees of the field shall clap their hands<br/>And you'll go out with joy.<br/></lines>
