      <lines>With a grateful heart,<br/>With a song of praise,<br/>With an outstretched arm<br/>I will bless Your name:<br/>Thank You, Lord,<br/>I just want to thank You, Lord,<br/>Thank You, Lord,<br/>I just want to thank You, Lord,<br/>Thank You, Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>For all You've done in my life;<br/>You took my darkness and gave me Your light,<br/>Thank You, Lord,<br/>Thank You, Lord.<br/>You took my sin and my shame,<br/>You took my sickness and healed all my pain,<br/>Thank You, Lord,<br/>Thank You, Lord.<br/></lines>
