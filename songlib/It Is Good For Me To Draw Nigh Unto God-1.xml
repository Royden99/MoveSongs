    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>It is good for me to draw nigh unto God,<br/>Lord, I put my trust in Thee.<br/>That I might declare all Thy works, Oh Lord,<br/>I put my trust in Thee.<br/>My heart and my flesh, they fail me.<br/>You are the strength of my life<br/>And my portion both now and evermore.<br/>There is none that I desire but Thee.</lines>
