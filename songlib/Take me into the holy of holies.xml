    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Take me past the outer courts<br/>      And through the Holy Place<br/>       Past the brazen altar, Lord, I want to see Your face.<br/>       Pass me by the crowds of people,<br/>       And the priests who sing their praise<br/>       I hunger and thirst for Your righteousness,<br/>       But it's only found one place.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>So take me into the Holy of Holies.<br/>      Take me in by the blood of the Lamb<br/>      So take me into the Holy of Holies;<br/>      Take the coal, cleanse my lips, Here I am.</lines>
