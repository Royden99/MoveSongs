    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>It's time for the babes to be children.<br/>It's time for the children to be sons.<br/>Time for the sons to be fathers.<br/>Time for God's people to be one.<br/>Chorus:<br/>O brethren, these are perilous times<br/>As the Lord by His servants hath warned.<br/>Can this be the answer, that we turn aside?<br/>Nay, but we shall arise and press on!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>It's time for the fearful to take courage.<br/>Time for the weak to be strong.<br/>Time for God's people to gather.<br/>Time for the Ark to move on.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>It's time for the Manchild to be born.<br/>Time for the trumpet to sound.<br/>Death still must be beaten,<br/>The time, fellow soldiers, is now.</lines>
    </verse>
