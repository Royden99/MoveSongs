    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Come and see, come and see<br/>Come and see the King of love;<br/>See the purple robe and crown of thorns he wears.<br/>Soldiers mock, rulers sneer<br/>As he lifts the cruel cross,<br/>Lone and friendless now he climbs towards the hill</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>We worship at your feet<br/>Where wrath and mercy meet,<br/>And a guilty world is washed<br/>By love's pure stream;<br/>For us he was made sin,<br/>Oh, help me take it in,<br/>Deep wounds of love cry out 'Father, forgive',<br/>I worship, I worship<br/>The Lamb who was slain.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Come and weep, come and mourn<br/>For your sin that pierced him there<br/>So much deeper than the wounds of thorn and nail;<br/>All our pride, all our greed,<br/>All our fallenness and shame<br/>And the Lord has laid the punishment on Him</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Man of heaven, born to earth<br/>To restore us to Your heaven,<br/>Here we bow in awe beneath<br/>Your searching eyes;<br/>From Your tears comes our joy,<br/>From Your death our life shall spring,<br/>By Your resurrection power we shall rise<br/></lines>
    </verse>
