    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I place all of my hope in Thee<br/>For that which my eyes do not yet see.<br/>For this work You've begun in me,<br/>Finish now as I embrace the cross.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Christ the Firstborn of many brethren<br/>Who yet will follow after Thee,<br/>Embraced the cross and was raised in power.<br/>Father, cause me now to be a Son.</lines>
