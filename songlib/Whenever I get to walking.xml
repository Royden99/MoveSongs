    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Whenever I get to walking in the word I've heard, <br/>Well, then my feet become like hind's feet , on the mountains<br/>Of the Lord, and I go leaping o'er the mountains.<br/>And I go skipping o'er the hills, I soar above the heavens<br/>Like an eagle, o'er the mountains and the fields. <br/>And I sing the songs of Zion, with a voice that's loud and sure. <br/>And the chains I've known become stepping stones <br/>Whenever I act upon God's Word</lines>
