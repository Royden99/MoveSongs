    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In prisoner's chains, with bleeding stripes<br/>Paul and Silas prayed that night<br/>And in their pain, began to sing<br/>Their chains were loosed, and they were free</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I bless Your Name, I bless Your name<br/>I give You honor, give you praise<br/>You are the Life, the Truth, the Way<br/>I bless Your name, I bless Your name</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Some midnight hour, if you should find<br/>You're in a prison in your mind<br/>Reach out and praise, defy those chains<br/>And they will fall in Jesus' name.</lines>
    </verse>
