      <lines>so you think that he can't find you<br/>that you've gone too far<br/>he's the god that finds the lost<br/>????? ninety-nine<br/>there's no place in heaven he can't hear your cry<br/>especially when you turn your heart<br/>that's when he likes to draw nigh<br/>o my child, he's there for you<br/>just open your heart and he'll make all things new<br/>o my child He's there for you<br/>just open your heart and he'll make all things new</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>there's no place in heaven that's just too far away<br/>he'll take your darkest hour<br/>and he'll give to you a new day<br/>o my child, he's there for you, just give him your heart and<br/>he'll make all things new.</lines>
