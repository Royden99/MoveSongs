    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>As a people travail in the heat of the sun<br/>There is hope in the victory of the Lord.<br/>With a heart that is groaning, the battle's begun<br/>To recover, redeem and restore.<br/>Chorus:<br/>So we fight for our brothers<br/>And fight for our sons,<br/>Go up for our daughters and wives.<br/>Fight for the house<br/>For the battle's begun<br/>And cry Victory! in the name of our God,<br/>And cry Victory! in the name of our God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Though the night closes in, we remain on the wall<br/>With a vision that shines like the day.<br/>Though the rubble surrounds us, not one man shall fall<br/>For together we work and we say...</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>With a spade in one hand and a sword at our side,<br/>The sound of the trumpet will call.<br/>With our hearts trained for war as the battle draws nigh,<br/>We will fight at our place on the wall.</lines>
