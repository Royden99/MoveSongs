    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!<br/>Let the earth hear His voice!<br/>Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!<br/>Let the people rejoice!<br/>O come to the Father<br/>Through Jesus the Son;<br/>And give Him the glory,<br/>Great things He hath done!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>To God be the glory!<br/>Great things He hath done!<br/>So lov'd He the world<br/>That He gave us His Son,<br/>Who yielded His life<br/>An atonement for sin,<br/>And open'd the lifegate<br/>That all may go in.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood!<br/>To every believer the promise of God;<br/>The vilest offender who truly believes,<br/>That moment from Jesus a pardon receives.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Great things He hath taught us,<br/>Great things He hath done,<br/>And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son:<br/>But purer and higher and greater will be<br/>Our wonder, our worship, when Jesus we see!</lines>
    </verse>
