    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The life of Jesus Christ in you will rise again<br/>The life of Jesus Christ in me will rise again<br/>Though the floods may seem to drown it <br/>or the fires of hell surround it<br/>though that life seems buried in a tomb<br/>it won't stay down.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>It will rise again, it will rise again<br/>Surely as the sun it will rise<br/>It will rise again, it will rise again<br/>Higher than the stars in the sky<br/>It can't stay down</lines>
