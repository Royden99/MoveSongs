      <lines>Would you take my hand as a token of intention<br/>That I want to be one with you?<br/>I know there are things we have got to go through,<br/>But I want to be one with you.<br/>By the love of God's grace set free in my spirit<br/>I give myself to you.<br/>At this moment in time I want you to know<br/>That I want to be one with you.<br/>At this moment in time I want you to know<br/>That I want to be one with you.</lines>
