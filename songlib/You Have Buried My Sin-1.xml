    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>You have buried my sin in the depths of the sea,<br/>Carried my guilt far away.<br/>As far as the East is from the West,<br/>You've removed my transgressions from me.<br/>So I'll tell of Your mercies, and sing of Your grace,<br/>Walk in Your liberty.<br/>And I'll live in the awesome light of Your love,<br/>'Cause I know that I am free,<br/>Yes, I know that I am free.<br/></lines>
