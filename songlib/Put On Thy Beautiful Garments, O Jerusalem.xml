    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>Put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem.<br/>Put on thy beautiful garments, lovely bride.<br/>Thou art a city filled with light,<br/>O, how glorious is thy sight.<br/>Put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When I passed by thee and looked upon thee,<br/>Behold, thy time was the time of love.<br/>I made a covenant and sware unto thee<br/>And thou becamest mine, beloved done.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Yea, then I washed thee, with oil anointed thee,<br/>And clothed thee with embroidered work and linen fine.<br/>With jewels and earrings rare have I adorned thee.<br/>Thou art all fair, my love, and thou art mine.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Thy garments smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia,<br/>Like a sweet garden, a bed of spice.<br/>The King doth greatly desire thy beauty,<br/>Thou art to me the pearl of greatest price.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>O turn thine eyes away, they overcome me.<br/>My heart is ravished, loved with such a sight.<br/>Thou art my precious one, thou art my glory.<br/>And thou art clothed in linen, clean and white.</lines>
    </verse>
