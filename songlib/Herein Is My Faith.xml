    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I believed, for the which I spoke.<br/>You are working Your will within me,<br/>That I might believe, believe only in You.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I know, there is power in Your name,<br/>And you are working Your will within me,<br/>That I might believe, believe only in You.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Often in tribulation, yet not in anguish,<br/>Pressed beyond measure, yet not despairing,<br/>Persecuted, never forsaken,<br/>Cast down and yet never destroyed.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>For herein is my faith,<br/>I will escape,<br/>To the mountains of safety on high.<br/>These trials are working in me<br/>A more excellent sure weight of glory.<br/>For herein is my faith,<br/>I will go on,<br/>Over waters obscuring the pathway.<br/>After my Lord and my Savior,<br/>I'll go. And I will cross over.<br/>For herein is my faith.</lines>
