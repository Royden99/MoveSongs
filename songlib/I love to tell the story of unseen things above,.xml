    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I love to tell the story of unseen things above,<br/>Of Jesus and His glory, of Jesus and His love;<br/>I love to tell the story, because I know 'tis true,<br/>It satisfies my longings, as nothing else can do.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I love to tell the story!  'Twill be my theme in glory<br/>To tell the old, old story of Jesus and His love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I love to tell the story; more wonderful it seems<br/>Than all the golden fancies of all my golden dreams;<br/>I love to tell the story, it did so much for me;<br/>And that is just the reason I tell it now to thee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I love to tell the story; 'tis pleasant to repeat<br/>What seems each time I tell it, more wonderfully sweet;<br/>I love to tell the story, for some have never hears<br/>The message of salvation from God's own holy word.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>I love to tell the story; for those who know it best<br/>Seem hungering and thirsting to hear it like the rest;<br/>And when, in scenes of glory, I sing the new, new song,<br/>'Twill be the old, old story, that I have loved so long.<br/></lines>
