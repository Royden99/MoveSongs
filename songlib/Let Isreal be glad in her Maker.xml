      <lines>So let Israel be glad in her Maker<br/>And the sons of Zion rejoice in their King.<br/>Let us praise His Name with dancing!<br/>Let us praise Him as we sing!<br/>Let us praise His Name with dancing!<br/>Let us praise Him as we sing!<br/>For the Lord has His joy in His people,<br/>And we have our joy in our King.</lines>
