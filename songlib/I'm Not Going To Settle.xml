    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I'm not gonna settle for anything less.<br/>God has given me the best.<br/>So I'll take it, and receive it, by faith.<br/>And when the enemy comes around;<br/>he's the one who's gonna be bound.<br/>For God's given all power to me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>There are no chains that now can bind me.<br/>There is nothing that can hold me down.<br/>So when the enemy comes around;<br/>he's the one who's gonna be bound.<br/>For God's given all power to me.</lines>
