      <lines>You gave Your only Son<br/>Came down from heaven above<br/>Endured the cross so I might know<br/>This love that reached for me<br/>A love that sets me free<br/>Your sacrifice has saved my soul</lines>

    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Praise You, Jesus I praise You<br/>I lift my hands and sing<br/>Embrace You, I will embrace You<br/>Saviour and my King, my King</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I could not earn this love<br/>Such undeserved love<br/>Jesus, I know You are the way,<br/>You paid the price for me,<br/>Your blood was shed for me<br/>And in Your mercy took my place<br/></lines>
