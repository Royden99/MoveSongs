    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Beneath the cross of Jesus I fain would take my stand,<br/>The shadow of a mighty rock within a weary land;<br/>A home within the wilderness, a rest upon the way,<br/>From the burning of the noontide heat, and the burden of the day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Oh safe and happy shelter, Oh refuge tried and sweet,<br/>Oh trysting place where Heaven’s love and Heaven’s justice meet!<br/>As to the holy patriarch that wondrous dream was given,<br/>So seems my Saviour’s cross to me, a ladder up to heaven.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There lies beneath its shadow but on the further side<br/>The darkness of an awful grave that gapes both deep and wide<br/>And there between us stands the cross, two arms outstretched to save<br/>A watchman set to guard the way from that eternal grave.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Upon that cross of Jesus mine eye at times can see<br/>The very dying form of One Who suffered there for me;<br/>And from my stricken heart with tears two wonders I confess;<br/>The wonders of redeeming love and my unworthiness.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>I take, O cross, thy shadow for my abiding place;<br/>I ask no other sunshine than the sunshine of His face;<br/>Content to let the world go by, to know no gain or loss,<br/>My sinful self, my only shame; my glory, all the cross.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
