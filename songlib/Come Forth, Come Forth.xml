    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Come forth, come forth from your father's house,<br/>Come forth from all you've known;<br/>A better country waits for you,<br/>Say that you will go.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Step out, step out and do not fear,<br/>Your journey's just begun;<br/>A Helper waits to guide you on,<br/>Until you're finally done.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Go in, go in to your husband's land,<br/>The place has been prepared;<br/>A house of promise waits for you,<br/>And He will meet you there.</lines>
    </verse>
