    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Show me a kingdom where righteous men meet.<br/>Show me a highway that is straight for their feet.<br/>And I'll show you a place where God's All in all.<br/>The Spirit is reigning, for they've answered His call.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Show me a brother in whom self has no part.<br/>Show me a sister who is pure in her heart.<br/>And I'll show you a person to whom God's All in all.<br/>The Spirit is reigning, for they've answered His call.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Show me a family where the sons are at peace.<br/>Show me a home in which love will increase.<br/>And I'll show you a dwelling where God's All in all.<br/>The Spirit is reigning, for they've answered His call.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Show me a church who have learned how to give.<br/>Show me a people who know how to live.<br/>And I'll show you a bride to who God's All in all.<br/>The Spirit is reigning, for they've answered His call.</lines>
