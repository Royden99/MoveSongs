    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>God will make a way<br/>Where there seems to be no way.<br/>He works in ways we cannot see.<br/>He will make a way for me.<br/>He will be my guide,<br/>Hold me closely to His side.<br/>With love and strength for each new day,<br/>God will make a way.<br/>God will make a way.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>By a roadway in the wilderness He'll lead me.<br/>And rivers in the dessert will I see.<br/>Heaven and earth will fade,<br/>But His word will still remain.<br/>He will do something new today.<br/>God will make a way.</lines>
