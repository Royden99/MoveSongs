    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Why should we be disturbed, and why should we fear.<br/>Why should we feel cast down, for the Lord, He is near.<br/>In His word, He has promised us, He won't leave us alone.<br/>And He wants us to be secure, in the love of a father for his son.<br/>Chorus:<br/>Underneath are the everlasting arms.<br/>Around our city are encamped the hosts of God.<br/>Our Shepherd watches over all his flock by night.<br/>And we can rest in His love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When the things I don't understand seem to cause me to doubt.<br/>And I find deep inside of me, many voices cry out.<br/>And I feel tired and weary, and my strength, it is gone.<br/>Then God's truth comes to set me free, and to fill me<br/>with courage to go on.</lines>
