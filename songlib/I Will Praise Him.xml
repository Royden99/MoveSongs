    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When I saw the cleansing fountain<br/>Open wide for all my sin,<br/>I obeyed the Spirit's wooing<br/>When He said "Wilt thou be clean?"</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I will praise Him, I will praise Him,<br/>praise Him,<br/>Praise the Lamb for sinners slain ...<br/>Give Him glory all ye people,<br/>For His blood has washed away my stain.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Though the way seemed straight and narrow,<br/>All I claimed was swept away;<br/>My ambition, plans and wishes,<br/>At my feet in ashes lay.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Then God's fire upon the altar<br/>Of my heart was set aflame;<br/>I shall never cease to praise Him,<br/>Glory!  glory!  to His name.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Bless√®d be the name of Jesus,<br/>I'm so glad He took me in;<br/>He has pardoned my transgressions,<br/>He has cleansed my heart from sin.<br/></lines>
