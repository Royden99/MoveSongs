    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We are listening for<br/>The most important voice we've ever heard,<br/>For it is calling us to walk where we've not gone;<br/>It is the voice that shook the wilderness<br/>To bring all Israel in,<br/>Into the fulness of the Father and the Son.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Beloved come, for I have purposed<br/>To have you in the earth<br/>In My full glory, in My image and in My name;<br/>Come, mount these steps, take My hand<br/>That I may bring you higher yet,<br/>That in a marriage with my Son<br/>You will be changed.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>We're in travail for<br/>The most important birth we've ever seen,<br/>Out of the union with the chosen and His Son,<br/>To bring forth righteousness and love<br/>From our Father God above,<br/>Flowing through this many-membered, corporate son.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>We are dying for<br/>The most important cause we've ever known,<br/>We are laying down our lives to gain a crown;<br/>This is a race that must be run,<br/>So rise up, for we have won<br/>The war with evil, and his kingdom's coming down!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>We are beholding<br/>The most important face we've ever seen,<br/>It is the face of One Who walked and overcame;<br/>He's calling us to rise in Him,<br/>To deny self and conquer sin,<br/>That in His likeness, we come forth bright as the sun.<br/></lines>
