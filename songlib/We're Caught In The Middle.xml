    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We're caught in the middle,<br/>Between the fire and the griddle,<br/>O Lord, what can we do?<br/>If we run away, we'll lose.<br/>If we stay, He'll light the fuse<br/>And totally blow us away.<br/>We're caught in the middle,<br/>Between the fire and the griddle,<br/>But His nature is seeing us through.<br/>We're caught in the middle,<br/>Between the fire and the griddle,<br/>Till suddenly all things become new.</lines>
