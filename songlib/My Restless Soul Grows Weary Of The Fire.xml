    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>My restless soul grows weary of the fire<br/>Considering only pain, the heat, the loss.<br/>Never remembering that the dear Refiner<br/>Hovers near to remove each bit of dross.<br/>Chorus:<br/>For He sits as a refiner and purifier of silver<br/>And He shall purify the sons of Levi.<br/>He shall purge than as gold and as silver<br/>That they may offer righteousness unto the Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He watches gently through each tribulation<br/>As He brings self-life ever to the test.<br/>And when at last He sees His Face reflected,<br/>The fire is gone and O the rest, sweet rest.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Think not that He desires to bring us testings<br/>To cause us sorrow, anguish, grief, and pain.<br/>He sees beyond each earthly trial to glory<br/>And knows that our self-loss is our eternal gain.</lines>
    </verse>
