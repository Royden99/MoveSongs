    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There's only one Lord, and there's only one light.<br/>There's only one way, that's to pay the price.<br/>Are you ready? Are you ready?<br/>To pay the price to walk in life.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>There's only one joy in this whole wide world.<br/>That's to know the Lord, and to walk in His word.<br/>Are you ready? Are you ready?<br/>To pay the price to walk in life.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There's no time to lose, for the hour is late.<br/>The Day of the Lord is approaching and there's no time to waste.<br/>Are you ready? Are you ready?<br/>To pay the price to walk in life. </lines>
