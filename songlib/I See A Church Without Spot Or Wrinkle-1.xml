    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I see a Church without spot or wrinkle.<br/>I see a manchild, coming on the earth.<br/>If you keep your vision sure, if you keep your heart pure,<br/>Then you'll see the woman, bringing forth the Son.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I see a woman, clothed with the sun.<br/>And the moon is under her feet.<br/>If you keep your vision sure, if you keep your heart pure,<br/>Then you'll see the woman, bringing forth the Son.</lines>
