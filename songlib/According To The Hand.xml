    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>According to the hand of the good Lord upon us<br/>We'll take this land, an exceeding good land.<br/>If the Lord delight in us then He will bring us<br/>To this land and give it to us.<br/>Only rebel ye not against the Lord,<br/>Neither fear ye the people of the land:<br/>They are bread for us,<br/>Their defence is departed from them,<br/>And the Lord is with us, fear them not!<br/></lines>
