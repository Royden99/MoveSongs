    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I heard an old, old story,<br/>How a Saviour came from glory,<br/>How He gave His life on Calvary<br/>To save a wretch like me;<br/>I heard about His groaning,<br/>Of His precious blood's atoning,<br/>Then I repented of my sins<br/>And won the victory.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Oh victory in Jesus,<br/>My Saviour, forever.<br/>He sought me and bought me<br/>With His redeeming blood;<br/>He loved me ere I knew Him<br/>And all my love is due Him,<br/>He plunged me to victory,<br/>Beneath the cleansing flood.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I heard about His healing,<br/>Of His cleansing power revealing.<br/>How He made the lame to walk again<br/>And caused the blind to see;<br/>And then I cried, "Dear Jesus,<br/>Come and heal my broken spirit,"<br/>And somehow Jesus came and brought<br/>To me the victory.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I heard about a mansion<br/>He has built for me in glory.<br/>And I heard about the streets of gold<br/>Beyond the crystal sea;<br/>About the angels singing,<br/>And the old redemption story,<br/>And some sweet day I'll sing up there<br/>The song of victory.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
