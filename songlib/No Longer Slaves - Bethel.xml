    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>You unravel me, with a melody<br/>You surround me with a song<br/>Of deliverance, from my enemies<br/>Till all my fears are gone</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I’m no longer a slave to fear, I am a child of God<br/>I’m no longer a slave to fear, I am a child of God</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>From my mothers womb<br/>You have chosen me<br/>Love has called my name<br/>I’ve been born again, into a family<br/>Your blood flows through my veins</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I am surrounded By the arms of the father<br/>I am surrounded By songs of deliverance<br/>We've been liberated From our bondage<br/>Were the sons and the daughters<br/>Let us sing our freedom</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>You split the sea<br/>So I could walk right through it<br/>My fears were drowned in perfect love<br/>You rescued me<br/>And I will stand and sing<br/>I am the child of God<br/>You split the sea<br/>So I could walk right through it<br/>You drowned my fears in perfect love<br/>You rescued me<br/>And I will stand and sing<br/>I am the child of God (yes I am)</lines>
