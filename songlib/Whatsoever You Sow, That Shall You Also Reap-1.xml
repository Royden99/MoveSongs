    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Whatsoever you sow, that shall you also reap<br/>This is eternal truth, there is no other way<br/>If you sow to the flesh, you'll reap corruption<br/>If you sow to the Spirit<br/>You'll reap everlasting life<br/>Every seed brings forth after it's kind<br/>What you sow you reap.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters<br/>Just faithfully do your part<br/>And the harvest will come up behind you<br/>He that goeth forth and weepeth<br/>Bearing precious seed<br/>Shall doubtless return again rejoicing<br/>Bringing his sheaves with him.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>God is a farmer, He planted a garden<br/>The invisible things of Him<br/>Are there quite clearly seen<br/>For the whole creation is a revelation <br/>Of the spiritual principles of Father God<br/>And the most important principle of all<br/>Is what you sow you reap.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Beloved, be not deceived; God is not mocked<br/>He is giving us an incorruptible seed<br/>And because He's giving us that kind of seed<br/>He intends to bring forth that kind of life<br/>For every seed brings forth after its kind.<br/>What you sow you reap.</lines>
