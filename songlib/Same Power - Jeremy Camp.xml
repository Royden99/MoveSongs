    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I can see , Waters raging at my feet <br/>I can feel , The breath of those surrounding me <br/>I can hear , The sound of nations rising up <br/>We will not be overtaken , We will not be overcome</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I can walk , Down this dark and painful road <br/>I can face , Every fear of the unknown <br/>I can hear , All God’s children singing out <br/>We will not be overtaken , We will not be overcome</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The same power that rose Jesus from the grave <br/>The same power that commands the dead to wake <br/>Lives in us, lives in us <br/>The same power that moves mountains when He speaks <br/>The same power that can calm a raging sea <br/>Lives in us, lives in us  - He lives in us, lives in us</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>We have hope , That His promises are true <br/>In His strength , There is nothing we can’t do <br/>Yes, we know , There are greater things in store <br/>We will not be overtaken , We will not be overcome</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Greater is He that is living in me - He’s conquered our enemy <br/>No power of darkness  - No weapon prevails <br/>We stand here in victory</lines>
    </verse>
