    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Morning has broken, like the first morning.<br/>Blackbird has spoken, like the first bird.<br/>Praise for the singing, praise for the morning,<br/>Praise for them springing fresh from the Word.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Sweet the rain's new fall, sunlit from heaven<br/>Like the first dewfall, on the first grass<br/>Praise for the sweetness of the wet garden<br/>Sprung in completeness where His feet pass</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Mine is the sunlight, mine is the morning<br/>Born of the one light, Eden saw play<br/>Praise with elation, praise every morning<br/>God's recreation of the new day</lines>
    </verse>
