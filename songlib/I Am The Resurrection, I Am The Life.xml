    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>I am the resurrection, I am the life.<br/>He that believeth in me, though he were dead,<br/>Yet shall he live. I am the resurrection and the life.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I speak it to my body, speak it to my soul,<br/>When sin and death lay outside my door.<br/>Speak it to disease, suffering and pain,<br/>Deny this realm for I am the gain.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Don't believe my feelings, symptoms or facts,<br/>Tempting voices stirring up doubts.<br/>I'll yield to His Spirit,<br/>The Great I Am within,<br/>Resurrected, quickening change in this life.</lines>
    </verse>
