    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Jesus Christ, the same today, yesterday, and forever.<br/>The captain of our battle shall surely never fail.<br/>He is raising up a Church that is made up of His body.<br/>Against them the gates of Hell shall not prevail.<br/>Chorus:<br/>Blow ye the trumpet and sound an alarm in Zion.<br/>The judgments of the Lord are surely neigh at hand.<br/>Gather up. Gather up the stones out of the highway.<br/>And prepare a pathway for the Son of Man.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>This army of the Lord is to rule with a rod of iron.<br/>Subduing all nations with the power of His might.<br/>We shall put them under foot. Then the kingdoms will<br/>become, the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ.</lines>
