    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We have nothing to give<br/>That didn’t first come from Your hands<br/>We have nothing to offer You<br/>Which You did not provide<br/>Every good, perfect gift comes from<br/>Your kind and gracious heart<br/>And all we do is give back to You<br/>What always has been Yours</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Lord, we’re breathing the breath<br/>That You gave us to breathe<br/>To worship You, to worship You<br/>And we’re singing these songs<br/>With the very same breath<br/>To worship You, to worship You.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Who has given to You<br/>That it should be paid back to him?<br/>Who has given to You<br/>As if You needed anything?<br/>From You and to You and through You<br/>Come all things, O Lord<br/>And all we do is give back to You<br/>What always has been Yours<br/></lines>
