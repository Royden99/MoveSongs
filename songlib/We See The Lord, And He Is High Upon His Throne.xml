    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We see the Lord, and He is high upon the throne,<br/>And His glory fills the heavens and the earth.<br/>One like a lamb Who was slain is on the throne,<br/>So I cast my crown before You and bow down to praise.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>For everything cries holy,<br/>Oh everything cries holy,<br/>Oh everything cries holy to You, Lord.<br/>For everything cries holy,<br/>Oh everything cries holy,<br/>Oh everything cries holy to You, Lord.<br/></lines>
