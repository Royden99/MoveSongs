      <lines>Worthy is the Lamb that was slain for you and me,<br/>Worship Him at His footstool, holy is He, holy is He.<br/>Behold the Lamb standing on Mt. Zion and His bride,<br/>With His name on their foreheads,<br/>And they cried with a mighty voice, Revere God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Who bow before Him and sing,<br/>Worthy is the Lamb that was slain for you and me,<br/>Worship Him at His footstool, holy is He, holy is He.<br/>Who shall not fear thee, O Lord<br/>But laud and glorify, for Thou alone art holy (thy name)</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And all nations come and worship Thee, for Thy judgments<br/>Are made manifest, they bow before Him and sing,<br/>Worthy is the Lamb that was slain for you and me,<br/>Worship Him at His footstool, holy is He, holy is He.<br/>Worthy is the Lamb that was slain for you and me,<br/>Worship Him at His footstool, holy is He, holy is He.</lines>
