    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I would be hopeless without Your goodness<br/>I would be desperate without Your love<br/>Slave to the darkness<br/>If it wasn't for the cross<br/>You have won me with Your kindness<br/>Chased me down when I was lost<br/>Where would I be?<br/>If it wasnâ€™t for the cross?<br/>Hallelujah, thank You, Jesus<br/>I was a prisoner, now I'm not<br/>With Your blood, You bought my freedom<br/>Hallelujah for the cross<br/>All my shame was met with mercy<br/>Now Your mercy will be my song<br/>And oh, the glory,<br/>Oh, the power of the cross<br/>By Your stripes, I'm healed<br/>By Your death, I live<br/>The power of sin is overcome<br/>It is finished, it is done<br/></lines>
