    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>God is doing a marvellous thing<br/>Finding the lost, healing the lame<br/>The brokenhearted are singing again<br/>And I'm a part of it all</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Hands that hung, now they are raised<br/>Lips that were bitter now sing God's praise<br/>And hearts that were hopeless find hope for each day<br/>And I'm a part of it all</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There is faith in lives where once there was doubt<br/>Those taken in whom the world has turned out<br/>And all the while learning what love's all about<br/>And I'm a part of it all<br/></lines>
