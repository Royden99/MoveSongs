    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He is able, He's able. I know He's able. <br/>I know my Lord is able to carry me through.<br/>For He has healed the broken-hearted, <br/>And set the captives free.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He made the lame to walk again, <br/>And caused the blind to see. <br/>For He is able, He's able. I know He's able.<br/>I know my Lord is able to carry me through.</lines>
