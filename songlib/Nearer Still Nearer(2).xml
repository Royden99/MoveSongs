    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Nearer, still nearer, close to Thy heart,<br/>Draw me, my Saviour, so precious Thou art;<br/>Fold me, O fold me close to Thy breast,<br/>Shelter me safe in that "Haven of Rest."</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Nearer, still nearer, nothing I bring,<br/>Naught as an offering to Jesus my King;<br/>Only my sinful, now contrite heart,<br/>Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Nearer, still nearer, Lord, to be Thine,<br/>Sin, with its follies, I gladly resign;<br/>All of its pleasures, pomp and its pride,<br/>Give me but Jesus my Lord crucified.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Nearer, still nearer, while life shall last,<br/>Till all its struggles and trials are past;<br/>Then through eternity, ever I'll be<br/>Nearer, my Saviour, still nearer to Thee.<br/></lines>
