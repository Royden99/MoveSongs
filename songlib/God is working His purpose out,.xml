    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>God is working His purpose out,<br/>as year succeeds to year;<br/>God is working His purpose out,<br/>and the time is drawing near -<br/>Nearer and nearer draws the time,<br/>the time that shall surely be,<br/>When the earth shall be filled<br/>with the glory of God,<br/>As the waters cover the sea.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>From utmost East to utmost West,<br/>where'er man's foot hath trod,<br/>By the mouth of many messengers<br/>goes forth the voice of God;<br/>Give ear to Me, ye continents<br/>ye isles, give ear to Me,<br/>That the earth may be filled<br/>with the glory of God,<br/>As the waters cover the sea.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>March we forth in the strength of God<br/>with the banner of Christ unfurled,<br/>That the light of the glorious Gospel of truth<br/>may shine throughout the world:<br/>Fight we the fight with sorrow and sin,<br/>to set their captives free,<br/>That the earth may be filled<br/>with the glory of God,<br/>As the waters cover the sea.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>All we can do is nothing worth,<br/>unless God blesses the deed;<br/>Vainly we hope for the harvest-tide<br/>till God gives life to the seed;<br/>Yet nearer and nearer draws the time<br/>- the time that shall surely be -<br/>When the earth shall be filled<br/>with the glory of God,<br/>As the waters cover the sea.<br/></lines>
