    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When He rolls up His sleeves He ain't just puttin' on the ritz.<br/>Our God is an awesome God.<br/>There is thunder in His footsteps and lightning in His fists.<br/>Our God is an awesome God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The Lord wasn't joking when He kicked 'em out of Eden.<br/>It wasn't for no reason that He shed His blood.<br/>His return is very close and so you'd better be believin' that<br/>Our God is an awesome God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Our God is an awesome God He reigns<br/>From heaven above<br/>With wisdom power and love<br/>Our God is an awesome God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>When the sky was starless in the void of the night<br/>Our God is an awesome God<br/>He spoke into the darkness and created the light.<br/>Our God is an awesome God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Judgement and wrath He poured out on Sodom.<br/>Mercy and grace He gave us at the cross<br/>I hope that we have not too quickly forgotten that</lines>
