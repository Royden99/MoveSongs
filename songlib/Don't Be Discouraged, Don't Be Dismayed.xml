    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Don't be discouraged, don't be dismayed.<br/>If the goal before you seems far away,<br/>Look all around you; you'll surely find<br/>Each growing thing takes one step at a time.<br/>You can only take one step, one step at a time<br/>To walk out of a valley, or a mountain to climb.<br/>At each day's dawning you'll surely find<br/>You can only take one step, one step at a time.</lines>
