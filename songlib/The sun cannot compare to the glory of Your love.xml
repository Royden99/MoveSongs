    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The sun cannot compare to the glory of Your love<br/>There is no shadow in Your Presence<br/>No mortal man would dare to stand before Your throne<br/>Before the Holy One of heaven<br/>It's only by Your Blood and it's only through you mercy<br/>Lord I come<br/>I bring an offering of worship to my King<br/>No one on earth deserves the praises that I sing<br/>Jesus may You receive the honor that You're due<br/>O Lord I bring an offering to You<br/>I bring an offering to You<br/></lines>
