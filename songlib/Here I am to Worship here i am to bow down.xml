    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Light of the World, You stepped down into darkness.<br/>	Opened my eyes, let me see.<br/>Beauty that made this heart adore You,<br/>Hope of a life spent with You.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>So, here I am to worship, here I am to bow down,<br/>Here I am to say that You're my God.<br/>And You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy,<br/>Altogether wonderful to me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>King of all days, oh so highly exalted,<br/>Glorious in heaven above.<br/>Humbly You came to the Earth You created,<br/>All for love's sake became poor.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>And I'll never know how much it cost<br/>To see my sin upon that cross.</lines>
    </verse>
