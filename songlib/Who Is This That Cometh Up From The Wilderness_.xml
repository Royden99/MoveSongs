      <lines>Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness?<br/>Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness?<br/>She's leaning on her beloved, leaning on her beloved.<br/>Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness?<br/>She's leaning on her beloved,<br/>Singing I am my beloved's and His desire is towards me.<br/>Singing I am my beloved's and His desire is towards me.</lines>
