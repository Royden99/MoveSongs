    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>You laid aside Your majesty,<br/>Gave up everything for me,<br/>Suffered at the hands of those You had created;<br/>You took all my guilt and shame<br/>When You died and rose again,<br/>Now today You reign<br/>In heaven and earth exalted.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I really want to worship You, my Lord,<br/>You have won my heart and I am Yours,<br/>Forever and ever I will love You;<br/>You're the only one Who died for me,<br/>Gave Your life to set me free<br/>So I lift my voice to You in adoration.<br/></lines>
