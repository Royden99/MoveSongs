      <lines>I will enter His gates with thanksgiving in my heart<br/>	I will enter His courts with praise<br/>	I will say, "This is the day that the Lord hath made."<br/>	I will rejoice for He hath made me glad.<br/>	He hath made me glad	<br/>           I will rejoice for He hath made me glad.</lines>
