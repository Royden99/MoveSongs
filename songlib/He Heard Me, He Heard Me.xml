    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He heard me, He heard me.<br/>With all of my heart I cried to Him and He heard me,<br/>And He answered and said, Follow me, and said, Follow me.<br/>I've taken the shackles off your feet,<br/>Your dancing toes can now keep beat<br/>To the rhythm of the song<br/>I've put in your heart;<br/>Follow Me, follow Me.</lines>
