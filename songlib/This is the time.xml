    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>This is the time<br/>When true worshipers will worship,<br/>These are the days<br/>When my Father's ways will be known to men,<br/>This is the hour<br/>When the spirit's power will move again,<br/>As we worship You in spirit and in truth,<br/>Lord, we worship You in spirit and in truth,<br/>Lord, we worship You in spirit and in truth.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Holy, holy, holy is Your name,<br/>Worthy, worthy, let all the earth proclaim,<br/>Mighty, mighty, there is no God like You,<br/>And we worship You in spirit and in truth.<br/></lines>
