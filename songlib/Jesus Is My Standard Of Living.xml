    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Jesus is my standard of living,<br/>I have riches here.<br/>I'm walking in the love of my Lord,<br/>While on this earthy sphere.<br/>I'm content to lay my treasures on the other side.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Jesus in my standard of living.<br/>He's the pattern Son, I'm longing to be like.<br/>He's making me into His image and likeness<br/>So I can be as Christ to the world.</lines>
