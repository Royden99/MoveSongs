    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Do you believe there was a man<br/>Who conquered every sin a man could face?<br/>Do you believe that this same man<br/>Won every war and captured every race?<br/>Do you believe, do you agree,<br/>That He slew death before His work was through?<br/>Do you believe this man of strength<br/>Can conquer anything that troubles you?<br/>Chorus:<br/>I do believe the things I see<br/>I do believe the God who lives in me<br/>My faith in You will be my guarantee<br/>That I'll become all that I'm meant to be.</lines>

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Do you believe that there will be<br/>A people bold enough to end this age?<br/>Do you believe that they will see<br/>Their Master finally turn the final page?<br/>Do you believe that there will be<br/>A people rising to the Kingdom's call?<br/>Do you believe that we're the ones?<br/>Do you believe that we can end it all?</lines>
