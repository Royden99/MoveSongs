    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He signed my deed with His atoning blood.<br/>He ever lives to make His promise good.<br/>Though all the hosts of hell march in<br/>To make a second claim,<br/>They all march out at the mention of His name.<br/>They all march out at the mention of His name.</lines>
