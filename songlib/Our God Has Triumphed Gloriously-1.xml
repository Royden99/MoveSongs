    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Our God has triumphed gloriously;<br/>The horse and the rider are thrown into the sea.<br/>The Lord is my strength and the Lord is my song<br/>And forever he will dwell in me.<br/>So sing, sing, sing unto the Lord.<br/>With timbrel and dances sing unto the Lord.<br/>The Lord is my strength,<br/>And the Lord is my song.<br/>And forever He will dwell in me.</lines>
