    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>His life within me, won't leave me the same.<br/>His life within me, knows dying is gain.<br/>His life within me, is changing my name.<br/>O glory to God, it's His life within.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>His life within me, can stand every test.<br/>His life within me, gives me complete rest.<br/>His life within me, will overcome death.<br/>O glory to God, it's His life within.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>His life within me, is making us one.<br/>His life within me, our trials overcomes.<br/>His life within me, knows it is done.<br/>O glory to God, it's His life within.</lines>
