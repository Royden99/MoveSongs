    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Who shall abide in the day of his coming?<br/>Who shall stand before His throne?<br/>Who will be true and uphold His mighty name?<br/>Only those who have become bone of His bone.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The judgments of the Lord surely come as a burning.<br/>Separating those who are willing to take His rod.<br/>Through chastening the Lord reveals to those who's hearts are yearning.<br/>That mighty is the man who knoweth his God.</lines>
    </verse>
