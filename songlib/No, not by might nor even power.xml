    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>No, not by might nor even power<br/>But by Your Spirit, O Lord,<br/>Healer of hearts, binder of wounds,<br/>Lives that are lost restored,<br/>Flow through this land till every man<br/>Praises Your name once more.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Let Your word go forth among the nations,<br/>Let Your voice be heard among the people,<br/>May they know our God, the only true God,<br/>Reigns on earth as You reign in heaven,<br/>May Your church be bold<br/>And speak with one voice,<br/>May our hearts be strong<br/>And never failing,<br/>May we know no fear,<br/>Except a holy fear of You, our King.<br/></lines>
