    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>For He has given the former rain,<br/>And caused it to come down,<br/>And the latter rain in the first month.<br/>With wheat the floor abounds.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The former rain came moderately,<br/>And did not satisfy.<br/>But the oil and the wine of the latter rain,<br/>It never shall run dry.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>And I will restore to you the years<br/>That the locusts have destroyed.<br/>In plenty you'll be satisfied,<br/>And praise the Lord your God.</lines>
