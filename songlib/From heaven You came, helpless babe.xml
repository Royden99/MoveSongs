    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>From heaven You came, helpless babe<br/>From heaven You came, helpless babe,<br/>Entered our world, Your glory veiled;<br/>Not to be served, but to serve<br/>And give Your life that we might live.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>This is our God, the servant King;<br/>He calls us now to follow Him,<br/>To bring our lives as a daily offering<br/>Of worship to the servant King</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There in the garden of tears<br/>My heavy load He chose to bear;<br/>His heart with sorrow was torn,<br/>“Yet not my will but Yours”, He said.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Come, see His hands and His feet,<br/>The scars that speak of sacrifice,<br/>Hands that flung stars into space<br/>To cruel nails surrendered.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>So let us learn how to serve<br/>And in our lives enthrone Him,<br/>Each other’s needs to prefer<br/>For it is Christ we’re serving.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
