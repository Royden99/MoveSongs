    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Light of the world,<br/>You stepped down into darkness<br/>Opened my eyes, let me see.<br/>Beauty that made this heart adore you.<br/>Hope of a life spent with you.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Here I am to worship,<br/>Here I am to bow down,<br/>Here I am to say that you're my God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>You're altogether lovely,<br/>Altogether worthy,<br/>Altogether wonderful to me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>King of all days O so highly exalted,<br/>Glorious in heaven above.<br/>Humbly you came to the earth you created<br/>All for love's sake became poor.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>I'll never know how much it cost <br/>To see my sin upon that cross.</lines>
