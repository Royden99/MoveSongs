    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Our God is an awesome God<br/>He reigns from heaven above<br/>With wisdom pow'r and love<br/>Our God is an awesome God</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When He rolls up His sleeves<br/>He ain't just puttin' on the ritz<br/>Our God is an awesome God<br/>There is thunder in His footsteps<br/>And lightning in His fists<br/>Our God is an awesome God</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And the Lord wasn't jokin'<br/>When He kicked 'em out of Eden<br/>It wasn't for no reason<br/>That He shed His blood<br/>His return is very close<br/>And so you'd better be believin'<br/>That our God is an awesome God</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>When the sky was starless<br/>In the void of the night<br/>Our God is an awesome God<br/>He spoke into the darkness<br/>And created the light<br/>Our God is an awesome God</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Judgment and wrath<br/>He poured out on Sodom<br/>Mercy and grace<br/>He gave us at the cross<br/>I hope that we have not<br/>Too quickly forgotten<br/>That our God is an awesome God</lines>
