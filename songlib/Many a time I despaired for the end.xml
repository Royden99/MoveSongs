    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Many a time I despaired for the end<br/>To the broken hearts crying around me; and then,<br/>Weary, yet moving, but wondering when<br/>I'll touch them and all their hearts mend.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>No more sorrow, no more wondering.<br/>Touch them, touch those<br/>Hearts that long to be free.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Though many times I just couldn't go on,<br/>I'd look for an answer to tell me I'm strong.<br/>Heal all my heartaches, don't leave them alone,<br/>Just touch them and call them Your own.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>The world is out looking for what I have here:<br/>A treasure, unmeasured, I must draw them near.<br/>Silence is ending, the end of all fear,<br/>So touch them and cry till they hear.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
