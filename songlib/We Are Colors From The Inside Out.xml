    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We are colors from the inside out.<br/>It's God's nature within us and it's working its way out.<br/>We are colors from the inside out.<br/>It's God's nature working its way out.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>In the beginning, God said, Let there be light.<br/>And in that light He made many colors.<br/>Each one was separate and called by name,<br/>Given a nature in Him, the same.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>God, He saw that it was good.<br/>Satan, He never understood.<br/>And those under his spell, they don't see so well.<br/>They don't see those colors as they should.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Green can be envy or God's new life.<br/>Blue can be self-pity or His authority.<br/>Yellow is a coward or God's nature perfect and true.<br/>Red is anger or His blood cleansing you.</lines>
