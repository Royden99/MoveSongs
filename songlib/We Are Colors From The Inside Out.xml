    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In the begining God said,<br/>"Let there be light"<br/>And in that light<br/>He made many colours,<br/>Each one was separate<br/>And called by a name,<br/>Given a nature in Him<br/>The same.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>We are colours<br/>From the inside out.<br/>It's God's nature within us<br/>And it's working its way out.<br/>We are colours<br/>From the inside out.<br/>It's God's nature<br/>Working its way out.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>God, He saw that it was good.<br/>Satan, he never understood.<br/>And those under his spell,<br/>They don't see so well,<br/>They don't see the colours<br/>As they should.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Green can be envy<br/>Or God's new life.<br/>Blue can be self-pity<br/>Or His authority.<br/>Yellow is a coward<br/>Or God's nature perfect and true.<br/>Red is anger<br/>Or His blood cleansing you.<br/></lines>
