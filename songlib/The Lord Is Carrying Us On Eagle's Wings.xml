    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The Lord is carrying us on eagle's wings,<br/>And we will rise above the storm.<br/>Not by flying away, but by overcoming,<br/>Not just one alone, but this many-membered son.<br/>On eagles' wings into the heavenlies,<br/>To go down unto death, the way of the cross,<br/>And then to rise into perfection,<br/>Going on to the fullness of God.</lines>
