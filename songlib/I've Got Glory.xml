    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I've got glory comin' at me from<br/>both sides.<br/>I've got glory fl owin' over me in tides.<br/>I've got glory shinin' on me like<br/>sunshine, it seems<br/>And it's You, my Father, beloved guide.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>We speak His Word throughout the land<br/>As we sit at His right hand<br/>Our names are written in the book with His blood.<br/>As we move in unity,<br/>We shall set the captives free<br/>And we long to hear the words,<br/>“Well done, my son.”</lines>
