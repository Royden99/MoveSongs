    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>From your cities come everyone,<br/>Up to Zion the chosen place;<br/>With all the brethren to dwell as one,<br/>Seeing Jesus face to face.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Oh come ye up and bring your branches,<br/>Come ye up, bring your wine and oil;<br/>Rejoice before Him with songs and dances,<br/>Come and live in the feast of joy.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Since the trumpet has sounded clear,<br/>Come be cleansed from self and sin;<br/>The celebration is drawing near,<br/>The King of glory shall come in.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
