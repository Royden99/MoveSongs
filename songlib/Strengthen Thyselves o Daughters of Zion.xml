    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Strengthen thyselves, oh daughters of Zion,<br/>Put on thy zeal as a garment.<br/>Strengthen thyselves, oh sons of the most High,<br/>Put on thy zeal as a mantle.<br/>CHORUS<br/>Strengthen thyselves in thy God,<br/>Lift up the hands that are weak,<br/>Strengthen thyselves,<br/>Oh strengthen thyselves in thy God.<br/>The Lord thy God does turn kings' hearts unto thee,<br/>To strengthen thy hands â€“<br/>to build up the house.<br/>Just as it was with the prophets of old,<br/>They now speak to the house,<br/>to strengthen your hearts.<br/>Wait on the Lord, be of good courage,<br/>And He shall strengthen your heart.<br/>Be of good courage, all that hope in the Lord,<br/>And He shall strengthen your heart.</lines>
