      <lines>You are a chosen generation, a holy nation,<br/>A priesthood of the royal line,<br/>Who should show forth the praises<br/>Of Him Who raised you<br/>Into His marvellous light;<br/>Who in time past were not a people,<br/>But are now the people of God,<br/>You are now, now, now the people of God.<br/></lines>
