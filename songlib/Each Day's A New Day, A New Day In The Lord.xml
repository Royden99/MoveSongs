    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Each day's a new day, a new day in the Lord;<br/>Each day's a new day to offer up His praises,<br/>Forgetting those things which are behind<br/>And looking unto those things before us,<br/>Each day's a new day, a new day in the Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And I don't have to be the same<br/>Today as I was yesterday,<br/>And I don't have to be the same tomorrow;<br/>Each day, each hour, each moment,<br/>I'm new in Him,<br/>Praise God He's changing me,<br/>Every moment I'm new in Him.<br/></lines>
