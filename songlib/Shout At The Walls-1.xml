    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Bring forth the dawn, For the time has now come <br/>That all mourning and weeping be cast away. </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Create anew as you speak forth the Word <br/>For we're pressing into a new day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Shout at the walls that stand in your way <br/>You see them fall. <br/>Lift up your eyes and behold a new day <br/>Where we live by a trumpet call</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Oh sons rejoice for the Word has now come <br/>That will bind and will lose and will set you free. </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Leave all behind, for the Word has now come <br/>That will create a purity. </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Bring down the faith that contains a new age <br/>And displaces the vision of yesterday. </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>New expectations are filling our hearts</lines>
