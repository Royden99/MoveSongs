    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There's a man in here who turns water to wine<br/>And He walks on the water and gives sight to the blind<br/>And He gives back life to the one's that's dead<br/>And He fed four thousand with seven loaves of bread<br/>There's a man in here who makes demons flee<br/>Who makes cripples walk and He's chosen even me<br/>For He lives in my heart and I have no fear<br/>I'm a better man, 'cause there's a man in here<br/>"There's a man in here that I'm lookin' for"<br/>Cries a man who could find no room at the door<br/>So they lowered him down on a stretcher bed<br/>And Jesus looked at him and said<br/>"All your sins are all now gone this day<br/>Take up your bed and go your way"<br/>And as he walked through the crowd they heard him declare<br/>I can tell you all there's a man in there</lines>

      <lines>"There's a man in here" the disciples cried<br/>When the ship was tossed from side to side<br/>So they woke Him up as the waves blew high<br/>And said, "Don't You care that we're about to die"<br/>And He said, "Peace be still" and when the wind had laid<br/>He said, "Where's your faith, why were you so afraid?"<br/>And when they saw that the sea was smooth and clear<br/>They said, "Thank you God that the man's in here"</lines>
