      <lines>You must remember not the former things<br/>Neither consider the things of old.<br/>You must remember not the former things<br/>Neither consider the things of old.<br/>Behold, I do a new thing and it shall spring forth.<br/>I'll make a way in the wilderness,<br/>And rivers in the desert.</lines>
