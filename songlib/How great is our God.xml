    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The splendor of the King, Clothed in majesty<br/>Let all the earth rejoice, All the earth rejoice<br/>He wraps himself in light, And darkness tries to hide<br/>And trembles at his voice, And trembles at his voice</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>How great is our God, Sing with me<br/>How great is our God, and all will see <br/>How great, How great Is our God</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Age to age he stands, And time is in His Hands<br/>Beginning and the End, Beginning and the End<br/>The Godhead, Three in One, Father, Spirit, Son<br/>The Lion and the Lamb, The Lion and the Lamb</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>You're the Name above all names<br/>You are Worthy of our praise<br/>My heart will sing how great Is our God</lines>
