    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>God promised Abraham a son,<br/>But Sarah laughed and said, "It can't be done;<br/>I am too old," she said; "it is impossible,"<br/>But in due time a son was born.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>So stagger not through unbelief,<br/>Be strong in faith, give God the praise.<br/>It looks uncrossable, with God it's possible,<br/>Have patience, then in God it's done.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The Red Sea lay right in their path,<br/>And Pharoah's army pressed them from behind;<br/>They were so desperate, they had no place to run,<br/>One step by faith, the seas did part!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>God said to Noah, "Go build an ark;<br/>All living things are soon to be destroyed."<br/>The people laughed and said,<br/>"It's not been done before,"<br/>But those inside the ark survived.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>The sons of God are going forth,<br/>Though hordes of wickedness at them are hurled.<br/>The battle's fierce and long, the enemy is strong,<br/>But at His command the battle's won!<br/></lines>
