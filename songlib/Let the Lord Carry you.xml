    <verse name="v1">
      <lines><br/>The father knows the destiny of each heart<br/>He knows the paths to choose for His flock<br/>To all those who sacrifice all to obey His voice<br/>Will be found in the place sanctioned by the Lords divine choice<br/><br/>Let the Lord carry you<br/>O Let the Lord carry you<br/>On the wings of His Spirit<br/>Up into the heavenlies <br/>Rising unto perfect peace<br/>High above life's storms<br/><br/>Gods grace is a strong tie <br/>that binds you to His side<br/>N matter what your next steps may unfold<br/>So sons be victorious<br/>And as you go on in Him</lines>
