    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I will dwell in His secret place,<br/>In His shadow I will abide,<br/>In His fortress I will take refuge,<br/>In my God, the Most High.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>From plague and from snare<br/>You are protected,<br/>You need not fear the dark of night,<br/>And with His wing you will be covered,<br/>Delivered from the wicked's might.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There shall no evil o'ercome you,<br/>Neither shall the plague come nigh,<br/>For He shall place His angels o'er you<br/>To keep you safe in all your ways.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>When I call to the Lord, He will answer,<br/>He will set my soul on high,<br/>He will be near in time of trouble,<br/>Give long life and satisfy.<br/></lines>
