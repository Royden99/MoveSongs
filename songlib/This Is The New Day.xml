      <lines>This is the new day of the Kingdom<br/>We lay aside the old<br/>We see each other by the spirit<br/>We are each other's wall<br/>We throw our crowns down at Your feet<br/>And offer them as one<br/>We compel the powers that rule this age<br/>To bow before Your Son<br/>We are a temple made of people establishing thy throne<br/>We stand together hand in hand,<br/>Making ourselves known<br/>We throw our crowns down at Your feet<br/>And offer them as one<br/>We call Your sheep from Babylon<br/>With joy we see them come<br/>Nations rise and nations call<br/>To hear Your prophets'voice<br/>Each one speaks and powers fall,<br/>In Your name they have no choice<br/>We throw our crowns down at Your feet,<br/>And offer them as one<br/>The hills resound with a marching beat,<br/>It's the Kingdom coming forth<br/></lines>
