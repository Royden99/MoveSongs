    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Draw me, I would run after Thee<br/>Draw me, I would run after Thee<br/>Until the day breaks, and the shadows flee away<br/>On the mountain of Bether, I would run after Thee.<br/>Do you know the meaning of the song?<br/>Is your heart surrendered all day long?<br/>Is your understanding open to understand<br/>The place of His dwelling on high?</lines>
