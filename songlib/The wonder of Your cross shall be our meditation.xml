    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The wonder of Your cross shall be our meditation<br/>To gather in that shadow when the sun went down,<br/>To weep with those who thought that You were leaving,<br/>You were leaving, Jesus,<br/>The humble King Who never wore an earthly crown.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>To steal away at night when they took down Your body,<br/>With love and tears to leave You in a borrowed grave,<br/>To go with Mary to the place they laid You,<br/>Where they laid You, Jesus,<br/>And in the morning find the stone was rolled away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The cross, O the wonderful cross!<br/>What glory, what victory, I've found.<br/>I'll come to the wonderful cross<br/>And my whole life I lay down.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Were heaven's praises silent in those hours of darkness?<br/>Your Holy Spirit brooding round that empty throne?<br/>Until the declaration 'He is Risen'. You are risen, Jesus,<br/>'He is not dead, behold He lives for evermore.'<br/></lines>
    </verse>
