    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He is here, hallelujah!<br/>He is here, amen!<br/>He is here, holy, holy!<br/>I will bless His holy name.<br/>He is here; listen closely.<br/>Here Him calling out your name.<br/>He is here; you can tough Him.<br/>You will never be the same.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I sense an awesome moving of the Holy Spirit.<br/>I see His countenance resting on your face.<br/>I know that there are angels hovering all around us,<br/>For the presence of the Lord is in this place.</lines>
