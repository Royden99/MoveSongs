    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The King is coming, the King is coming,<br/>I can hear the trumpet sounding,<br/>And His face I now can see.<br/>The King is coming, the King is coming,<br/>Praise the Lord, He's coming in me!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The marketplace is empty,<br/>No more traffic in the streets,<br/>All the builders' tools are silent,<br/>No more time to harvest wheat;<br/>Busy housewives cease their labours,<br/>In the courtroom, no debate,<br/>Work on earth is all suspended<br/>As the King comes through the gate.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Happy faces line the hallways,<br/>Those whose lives have been redeemed,<br/>Broken homes that He has mended,<br/>Those from prison He has freed;<br/>Little children and the aged<br/>Hand in hand stand all aglow,<br/>Who were crippled, broken, ruined,<br/>Clad in garments white as snow.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I can hear the chariots rumble,<br/>I can see the marching throng,<br/>The flurry of God's trumpets<br/>Spells the end of sin and wrong:<br/>Regal robes are now unfolding,<br/>Heaven's grandstand's all in place,<br/>Heaven's choir now assembled,<br/>Start to sing "Amazing Grace!"<br/></lines>
    </verse>
