    <verse name="v1a">
      <lines>Who are these, which are arrayed in white robes?<br/>Who are these, and from where do they come?<br/>These are they who came out, (2x)<br/>These are they who come out of great tribulation. </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>And they have washed their robes and made them white,<br/>They have washed their robes and made them white (2x) <br/>In the blood of the Lamb.</lines>
