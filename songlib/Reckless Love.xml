    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Before I spoke a word, You were singing over me<br/>You have been so, so good to me<br/>Before I took a breath, You breathed Your life in me<br/>You have been so, so kind to me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God<br/>Oh, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm found, leaves the ninety-nine<br/>I couldn't earn it, and I don't deserve it, still, You give Yourself away<br/>Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God, yeah</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>When I was Your foe, still Your love fought for me<br/>You have been so, so good to me<br/>When I felt no worth, You paid it all for me<br/>You have been so, so kind to me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>There's no shadow You won't light up<br/>Mountain You won't climb up, Coming after me<br/>There's no wall You won't kick down<br/>Lie You won't tear down,Coming after me   (REPEAT)</lines>
