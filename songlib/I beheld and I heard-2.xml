    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I beheld and heard the voice of many angels<br/>Round about the throne and the beasts and the elders<br/>And the number of them was ten thousands times ten thousand<br/>Thousands of thousands shouting with a loud voice</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Blessings and honor and glory and power<br/>Be unto Him that sits upon the throne<br/>And unto the Lamb forever and ever<br/>Worthy is the Lamb that was slain.</lines>
