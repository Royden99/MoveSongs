    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God<br/>With all thy heart, and soul, and might,<br/>And thy neighbor as thyself.<br/>Engrave these words upon thine heart.<br/>When thy son shall ask of Thee,<br/>What do these commandments mean?<br/>You shall say, We are alive<br/>Because they taught our hearts to fear.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Make them frame the works of your hands,<br/>Build up the poses of your house,<br/>Guard the vision of your eyes,<br/>Constantly watch at your gates.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Teach when you sit in the house,<br/>Talk when you walk in the way.<br/>Pray at the time that you lie down,<br/>Sing when you rise up in the day.</lines>
    </verse>
