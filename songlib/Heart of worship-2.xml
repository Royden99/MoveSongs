    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When the music fades,<br/>And all is stripped away,<br/>And I simply come.<br/>Longing just to bring something that's of worth,<br/>That will bless Your heart.<br/>Chorus:<br/>I'll bring You more than a song,<br/>For a song in itself,<br/>Is not what You have required.<br/>You search much deeper within,<br/>Through the way things appear,<br/>You're looking into my heart.<br/>I'm coming back to the heart of worship.<br/>And it's all about You, all about You, Jesus.<br/>I'm sorry Lord for the thing I've made it,<br/>When it's all about You, all about You, Jesus.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>King of endless worth,<br/>No one could express how much You deserve.<br/>Though I'm weak and poor,<br/>All I have is Yours, every single breath.</lines>
