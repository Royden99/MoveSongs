    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>You have called us by Your Spirit into worship<br/>In this temple You have set our hearts aflame<br/>As we lay our hearts upon Your holy altar<br/>We'll be blessed in Jesus' name</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Let us cleanse our hearts as we begin to worship<br/>Let us fill our hearts with love for You and sing<br/>Open up our eyes so we may come to know You<br/>And unto us the Spirit bring<br/></lines>
