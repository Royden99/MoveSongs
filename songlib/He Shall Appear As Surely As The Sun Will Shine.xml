    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He shall appear as surely as the sun will shine,<br/>As the former and latter rains, on time.<br/>He will come to heal, to revive and to restore.<br/>So come, and let us return unto the Lord,<br/>Let us follow on to know the Lord,<br/>And live in His presence ever more.<br/></lines>
