    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I will sing the wondrous story<br/>Of the Christ Who died for me,<br/>How He left His home in glory<br/>For the cross of Calvary.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story<br/>Of the Christ Who died for me,<br/>Sing it with the saints in glory,<br/>Gathered by the crystal sea.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I was lost but Jesus found me,<br/>Found the sheep that went astray,<br/>Threw His loving arms around me,<br/>Drew me back into His way.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I was bruised but Jesus healed me,<br/>Faint was I from many a fall,<br/>Sight was gone, and fears possessed me<br/>But He freed me from them all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>He will keep me till the river<br/>Rolls its waters at my feet;<br/>Then He'll bear me safely over,<br/>Where the loved ones I shall meet.<br/></lines>
