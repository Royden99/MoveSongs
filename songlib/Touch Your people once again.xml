    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Touch Your people once again<br/>With Your precious holy hand, we pray.<br/>Let Your kingdom shine upon this earth <br/>Through a living glorious church.<br/>Not for temporary deeds <br/>But to restore authority and power.<br/>Let a mighty rushing wind blow in. <br/>Touch Your people once again.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>We need wisdom, we need power <br/>And true love for each other. <br/>We have had so many big but empty words <br/>So we come before Your face <br/>Asking for Your grace.<br/>Bring Your people to a state of kingdom life.<br/>Restore Your church again.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Lord You see Your tired servants <br/>And Your broken, wounded soldiers. <br/>O, how much we need Your precious healing hand.<br/>We need the power of Your cross <br/>As the only source for us<br/>As we stand up, facing final battle cry. <br/>Restore Your church again.</lines>
