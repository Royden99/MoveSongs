    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I've been redeeemed by the blood of the Lamb (x3)<br/>Filled with the Holy Ghost I am,<br/>All my sins are washed away, I've been redeemed.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And that's not all, there's more besides: (x3)<br/>I've been to the river and I've been baptised,<br/>All my sins are washed away, I've been redeemed.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Now Satan's mad, and I am glad, (x3)<br/>He's lost a soul that he thought he'd had,<br/>All my sins are washed away, I've been redeemed.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>You can talk about me, just as much as you please, (3x)<br/>I'll talk about you down on my knees,<br/>All my sins are washed away, I've been redeemed.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>There's a little seed, in you and me, (3x)<br/>Growing up to incorruptibility;<br/>All my sins are washed away, I've been redeemed.<br/></lines>
