    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen<br/>And become the habitation of devils<br/>And the hold of every foul spirit<br/>And the cage of every unclean bird.<br/>Come ye out, people of God,<br/>Come ye out, come ye out.<br/>For the Lord has prepared a place for you<br/>We shall reign with Him forever, for eternity<br/>Come ye out, people of God, come ye out.</lines>
