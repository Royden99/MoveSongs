    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>As sure as gold is precious and the honey sweet<br/>So You love this city and You love these streets:<br/>Every child out playing by their own front door,<br/>Every baby lying on the bedroom floor</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Every dreamer dreaming in their dead-end job,<br/>Every driver driving through the rush hour mob;<br/>I feel it in my spirit feel it in my bones:<br/>You're going to send revival bring them all back home.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I can hear the thunder in the distance;<br/>It's like a train on the edge of the town;<br/>I can feel the brooding of Your Spirit:<br/>Lay your burdens down,<br/>Lay your burdens down.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>From the preacher preaching when the well is dry<br/>To the lost soul reaching for a higher high;<br/>From the young man working through his hopes and fears<br/>To the widow walking through the veil of tears;</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Every man and woman every old and young,<br/>Every father's daughter, every mother's son;<br/>I feel it in my spirit feel it in my bones:<br/>You're going to send revival bring them all back home.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>I can hear the thunder in the distance;<br/>It's like a train on the edge of the town;<br/>I can feel the brooding of Your Spirit:<br/>Lay your burdens down,<br/>Lay your burdens down.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
