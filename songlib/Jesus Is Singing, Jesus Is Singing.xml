    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Jesus is singing, Jesus is singing;<br/>In the midst of the Church, He's singing for joy;<br/>Jesus is singing while we are singing<br/>So let us together lift our voice.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Praise ye the Lord, for it is good,<br/>Good to sing praises unto our God,<br/>He healeth the broken in heart<br/>And binds up their wounds;<br/>He telleth the number of the stars,<br/>He calleth them all by their names,<br/>The Lord lifteth up the meek,<br/>Praise ye the Lord!<br/></lines>
