      <lines>See the laughing army<br/>Dancing in the streets<br/>Singing out their battle cry<br/>With a tamborine<br/>For the time has now arrived<br/>To possess our land<br/>And proclaim to all the world<br/>"His Kingdon is at hand" - for...<br/>We shall never be the same again<br/>The army of God<br/>has taken over the land<br/>The kings of this world<br/>are now the kings of our God<br/>They rule and reign forever<br/>See the laughing army<br/>Sounding out the call<br/>For the sons to rally<br/>To see the final fall<br/>Of the great whore Babylon<br/>And her earthly kings<br/>That will never rise again<br/>The laughing army sings - that...<br/>See the laughing army<br/>Going through the earth<br/>As the nation Israel<br/>Quickly comes to birth<br/>Fighting as his warriors<br/>Ten thousand prophets strong<br/>With the weapons of their God<br/>A laughing army song - that...<br/></lines>
