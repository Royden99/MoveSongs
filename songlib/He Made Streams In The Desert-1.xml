    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>He made streams in the desert.<br/>A way in the wilderness,<br/>The waters, He parted, and there was dry land.<br/>He made streams in the desert, a way in the wilderness,<br/>Because I held to his hand.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>There were times I know it when my feet were nigh slipping,<br/>And only by grace did I stand.<br/>And the load I carried, I bent down below it,<br/>But I did not let go of His hand.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And the tempter untiring, drew grand conclusions.<br/>Of what a poor fool I am: but through waves of worry,<br/>And clouds of confusion,<br/>Still I did not let go of his hand.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>And so my brethren, commit to His keeping,<br/>Your lives for Him to plan, for though trials be grievous,<br/>There's no shame in weeping,<br/>Just don't let go of His hand.</lines>
