      <lines>If He keeps on blessing and blessing. <br/>If He keeps on pouring it on. <br/>If His love just keeps getting richer,<br/>And He keeps on giving a song. <br/>If my cup gets fuller and fuller, <br/>And my prayers keep on getting through.<br/>If it keeps getting better and better, O Lord, <br/>I don't know what I'm gonna do!</lines>
