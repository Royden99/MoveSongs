    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>It's your heart, it's your heart,<br/>It's your heart in this matter that counts,<br/>O my son.                              (x2)<br/>So let your windows of heaven all be opened again,<br/>And be healed by His wonderful love.     (x2)</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Many things you can see<br/>Will take your eyes off of me;<br/>Many windows there are<br/>To draw you so far<br/>Away from what the Lord<br/>Would have you to be:<br/>Let your windows of heaven<br/>Be opened again.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>So be careful as you choose<br/>And you'll be sure not to lose<br/>Your new-found sight of My purpose<br/>As I deal with you;<br/>As you keep your heart right,<br/>You'll see with new sight,<br/>And your windows of heaven<br/>Will be opened again.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Some did look through a window,<br/>To judge and to scorn.<br/>Another sat in His window<br/>And after death was reborn.<br/>But there's a window that's above,<br/>And as you choose to live and love,<br/>That blessed window of heaven<br/>Will be opened again.<br/></lines>
