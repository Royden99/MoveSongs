      <lines>Who is on the Lord's side, stand and be counted,<br/>Who is on the Lord's side, walk with me,<br/>Who is on the Lord's side, stand and be counted<br/>For eternity.<br/>As for me and my house, we will serve Him,<br/>As for me and my house, we will stand,<br/>Who is on the Lord's side, stand and be counted<br/>For the promised land.<br/></lines>
