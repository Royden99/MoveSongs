    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>King David danced before the Lord x3<br/>On his kinsfolk it was hard,<br/>All my sins are taken away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>All my sins are taken away x3<br/>I'm rejoicing night and day,<br/>All my sins are taken away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The ark is coming down the road x3<br/>Coming back to its abode,<br/>All my sins are taken away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>The praises go before the sword x3<br/>For the battle is the Lord's,<br/>All my sins are taken away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>I'm not going to listen to any more lies x3<br/>There's no room for compromise,<br/>All my sins are taken away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>There's only room for the Word of the Lord x3<br/>And the cutting of His sword,<br/>All my sins are taken away.<br/></lines>
