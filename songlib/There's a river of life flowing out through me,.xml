    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There's a river of life flowing out through me,<br/>It makes the lame to walk and the blind to see,<br/>It opens prison doors, sets the captives free,<br/>There's a river of life flowing out through me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Spring up, O well, within my soul,<br/>Spring up, O well, and make me whole;<br/>Spring up, O well, flow out through me,<br/>Spring up, O well, set others free.<br/></lines>
