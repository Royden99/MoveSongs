    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>With Jesus I can do all things<br/>With Jesus I cannot fail<br/>With Jesus all things are possible<br/>In His Name I shall prevail</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Jesus, Oh Jesus, Do you know Him today<br/>Do not turn away<br/>Oh Jesus, Oh Jesus.<br/>Without Him, how lost I would be.</lines>
