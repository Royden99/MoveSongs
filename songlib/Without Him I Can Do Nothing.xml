      <lines>Without Him I can do nothing<br/>Without Him I'd surely fail<br/>Without Him I would be drifting<br/>Like a ship without a sail</lines>

      <lines>With Jesus I can do all things<br/>With Jesus I cannot fail<br/>With Jesus all things are possible<br/>In His Name I shall prevail</lines>

      <lines>Jesus, Oh Jesus, Do you know Him today<br/>Do not turn away<br/>Oh Jesus, Oh Jesus.<br/>Without Him, how lost I would be.</lines>
