    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He who began a good work in you,<br/>         He who began a good work in you,<br/>         He will be faithful to complete it,<br/>         He will be faithful to complete it,<br/> He who started the work<br/> Will be faithful to complete it in you.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>If the struggle you're facing is slowly replacing<br/>Your hope with despair.<br/>For the process is long and you're losing<br/>Your song in the night.<br/>For you can be sure that the Lord has His hand on you.<br/>Safe and secure, He will never abandon you;<br/>         You are His treasure and He has His pleasure in you.</lines>
