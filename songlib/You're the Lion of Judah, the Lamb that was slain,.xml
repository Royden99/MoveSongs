    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>You're the Lion of Judah, the Lamb that was slain,<br/>You ascended to heaven and ever more will reign;<br/>At the end of the age when the earth You reclaim,<br/>You will gather the nations before You.<br/>And the eyes of all men will be fixed on the Lamb<br/>Who was crucified,<br/>For with wisdom and mercy and justice You'll reign<br/>At Your Father's side.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And the angels will cry: 'Hail the Lamb<br/>Who was slain for the world, Rule in power.'<br/>And the earth will reply: 'You shall reign<br/>As the King of all kings<br/>And the Lord of all lords.'</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There's a shield in our hand and a sword at our side,<br/>There's a fire in our spirits that cannot be denied;<br/>As the Father has told us for these You have died,<br/>For the nations that gather before You.<br/>And the ears of all men need to hear of the Lamb<br/>Who was crucified,<br/>Who descended to hell yet was raised up to reign<br/>At the Father's side.<br/></lines>
