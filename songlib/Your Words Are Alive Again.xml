    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Your words are alive again,<br/>And again, Your words shall be alive in me.<br/>Through every test and trial, through the darkest mile,<br/>They shall be comforting.<br/>And in each season of my life,<br/>Your word as a lamp shall be my light.<br/>Your words shall remain in me as I abide in You.</lines>
