      <lines>Days are filled with sorrow and care,<br/>Hearts are lonely and drear;<br/>Burdens are lifted at Calvary,<br/>Jesus is very near.<br/>Burdens are lifted at Calvary,<br/>Calvary, Calvary,<br/>Burdens are lifted at Calvary,<br/>Jesus is very near.<br/>Cast your care on Jesus today,<br/>Leave your worry and fear;<br/>Burdens are lifted at Calvary,<br/>Jesus is very near.<br/>Troubled soul, the Saviour can see,<br/>Evâ€™ry heartache and tear;<br/>Burdens are lifted at Calvary<br/>Jesus is very near.<br/></lines>
