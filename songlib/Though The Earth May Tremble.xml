    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Though the earth may tremble,<br/>Though the crops may fail,<br/>I have been to the source of life,<br/>It's the water in the well.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>It's the well of living water,<br/>And I shall thirst no more.<br/>He's the well of living water;<br/>I've never known such joy.</lines>
