    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We are being built into a temple,<br/>Fit for God's own dwelling place;<br/>Into the house of God which is the Church,<br/>The pillar and the ground of truth.<br/>As precious stones that Jesus owns,<br/>Fashioned by His wondrous grace;<br/>And as we love and trust each other,<br/>So the building grows and grows.<br/></lines>
