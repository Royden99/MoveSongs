    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>it's that precious, priceless, powerful, praising<br/>Wonderful life in me<br/>I can climb any mountain<br/>I can walk on top of the sea<br/>I can cast down any stronghold<br/>That this world might have on me<br/>By that precious, priceless, powerful, praising<br/>Wonderful life in me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>In the morning when I arise <br/>And get on my knees to pray<br/>It should come as no surprise <br/>The devil's got something to say<br/>Words of doubt and words of fear he tries to get to me<br/>But in the name of Jesus I tear his lies to pieces<br/>And the devil just has to flee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Now that old devil he won't quit trying <br/>To keep me from the light<br/>Walking about like a roaring lion trying to take a bite<br/>Still the Lord gives me the victory <br/>So I praise Him more and more<br/>As I keep on abiding He'll keep on guiding <br/>And there's victory in store.</lines>
