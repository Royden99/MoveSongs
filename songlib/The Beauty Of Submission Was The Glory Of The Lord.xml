    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The beauty of submission was the glory of the Lord<br/>As He gave Himself completely to the Father's will and word.<br/>And through all the countless ages<br/>Men and angels will always sing<br/>Of the beauty of submission that crowned Him King of kings.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The beauty of submission is the glory of the bride.<br/>As she yields herself completely to Him who's called her to His side.<br/>For she lives to see His glory,<br/>And she dies to know His life.<br/>It's the beauty of submission that's the glory of the bride.</lines>
