    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Can You hear the sound of heaven<br/>It's the sound of many waters<br/>It's the sound of worship coming from the Throne<br/>There are cries of adoration, as men from every nation<br/>Lift their voice to make His glory known<br/>Singing</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Holy, holy, holy are you Lord (2x)<br/>The elders and the angels bow<br/>The redeemed worship you now<br/>Holy, holy, holy are you Lord.</lines>
