    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We shall lift up our voice.<br/>We shall cry with joy.<br/>We shall shout aloud and be free.<br/>We shall glorify the name of the Lord.<br/>We're the blood-bought,<br/>The church, the redeemed.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>O, lift up your voice,<br/>Ye islands of the sea.<br/>Every created being, fold your wings.<br/>There's a new song being sung with a new melody.<br/>We're the blood-bought,<br/>The church, the redeemed.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And we are in that army of the Lord.<br/>We're being washed in the blood,<br/>And we are going forth.<br/>There's nothing that can stop<br/>This mighty moving force<br/>With a shout of praise and a two-edged sword.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Every strong-hold of bondage<br/>Must fall beneath our feet.<br/>Every prisoner held captive must be free.<br/>Our deliverance has come<br/>Through the power of the Son.<br/>We're the blood-bought,<br/>The church, the redeemed.</lines>
