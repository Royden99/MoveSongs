      <lines>Tender words I speak to my brother.<br/>Tender words he speaks to me.<br/>Tender words make all the difference.<br/>Even though we may disagree.<br/>Tender words, they are spirit.<br/>They are spirit, and they are life.<br/>Tender words make all the difference.<br/>They take away all division and strife.</lines>
