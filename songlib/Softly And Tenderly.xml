    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Why should we tarry<br/>When Jesus is pleading,<br/>Pleading for you and for me?<br/>Why should we linger<br/>And heed not His mercies,<br/>Mercies for you and for me?</lines>

    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Oh for the wonderful<br/>Love He has promised,<br/>Promised for you and for me!<br/>Though we have sinned,<br/>He has mercy and pardon,<br/>Pardon for you and for me.</lines>
