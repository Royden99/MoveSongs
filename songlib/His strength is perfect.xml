    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength<br/>But sometimes I wonder what he can do through me<br/>No great success to show, No glory of my own<br/>yet in my weakness he is there to let me know</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>His strength is perfect when our strength is gone<br/>He'll carry us when we can't carry on<br/>Raised in his power the weak becomes strong<br/>His strength is perfect, His strength is perfect</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>We can only know that power that he holds<br/>When we truly see how deep our weakness goes<br/>His strength it must begin, When ours comes to an end<br/>He hears our humble cry and proves again</lines>
    </verse>
