    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Come let us sing unto the Lord<br/>Let us make a joyful noise<br/>To the rook of our salvation<br/>Come let us sing unto the Lord<br/>Let us come before his presence<br/>With Thanksgiving in our hearts</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>For the Lord is a great God<br/>and a great king above all gods<br/>In His hands are the land and the sea<br/>For the Lord is a great God<br/>And a great king above all gods<br/>In the beauty of His sanctuary<br/>We know His strength and majesty<br/>The Lord He is a great God</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Come let us worship and bow down<br/>Let us kneel before our maker <br/>We're the people of his pasture <br/>Come let us worship and bow down<br/>For the Lord He is our God<br/>We're the sheep of His hand</lines>
