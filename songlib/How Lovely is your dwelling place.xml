    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>How lovely  is Thy dwelling place, O Lord my God<br/>My heart longs, longs and faints for Thy courts<br/>And I would rather be a doorkeeper in Thy house<br/>Than to live all my life somewhere else.<br/>You are my sun, You are my shield<br/>You are my lover from the start <br/>And the highway to Thy city<br/>Runs through my heart.</lines>
