    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>I'm goin' home.<br/>Going back to the bosom of my Father.<br/>He's callin' me; He's callin' me<br/>Up to the fountain of the waters.<br/>As the salmon returns from the sea,<br/>He's callin' me; He's callin' me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Comin' out of the salt of the sea,<br/>Pressin' on through the strength of the stream,<br/>Past the fowls of the air,<br/>And the hungry bear,<br/>He's callin' me; He's callin' me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Goin' back through the veil of the flesh,<br/>Through the fire to purge out the dross.<br/>The way of the cross,<br/>Counting all else as loss.<br/>He's callin' me; He's callin' me.</lines>
    </verse>
