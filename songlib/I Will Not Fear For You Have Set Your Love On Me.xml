      <lines>I will not fear<br/>For You have set Your love on me<br/>And I will not turn back.<br/>With my eyes on the prize<br/>Of being one with You forever,<br/>Your blood brings me nearer,<br/>And I will not turn back.</lines>
    </verse>

      <lines>Your loving kindness is better than life<br/>And Your mercies endureth forever and ever.<br/>I will not leave the One Who has set<br/>His love so strongly on me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I will not fear<br/>Even though You slay me,<br/>For You'll never leave me.<br/>Nothing can separate me,<br/>Lord, from You,<br/>Not life, nor death; You'll not forsake me,<br/>And I will not turn back.<br/></lines>
