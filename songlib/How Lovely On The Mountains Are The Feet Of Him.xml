    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>How lovely on the mountains are the feet of him<br/>That brings good news, good news,<br/>Proclaiming peace, announcing news of happiness:<br/>Our God reigns, our God reigns!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Our God reigns, our God reigns,<br/>Our God reigns, our God reigns.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Ye watchmen lift your voices joyfully as one,<br/>Shout for your King, your King;<br/>See eye to eye the Lord restoring Zion;<br/>Our God reigns, our God reigns!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Waste places of Jerusalem break forth with joy.<br/>We are redeemed, redeemed;<br/>The Lord has saved and comforted His people;<br/>Our God reigns, our God reigns!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Ends of the earth see the salvation of your God,<br/>Jesus is Lord, is Lord;<br/>Before the nations He has bared His holy arm;<br/>Our God reigns, our God reigns!<br/></lines>
