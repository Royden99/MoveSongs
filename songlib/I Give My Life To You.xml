    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I don't want to live for my own selfish gain<br/>In endless cycles of my sin<br/>I know you called me to your purposes<br/>I wouldn't trade it for the world<br/>Chorus:<br/>I give my life to You<br/>I'm ready to give You, the life that I've known<br/>I give my heart to You<br/>Take all of me, I believe in You</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I know with You I can do anything<br/>Your grace has freed me from my fear<br/>I know that I could be an instrument<br/>I wouldn't trade it for the world</lines>
