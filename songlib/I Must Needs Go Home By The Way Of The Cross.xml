    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I must needs go home by the way of the cross.<br/>There's no other way but this.<br/>I will ne'er gain sight of the gates of light,<br/>If the way of the cross I miss.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>O, the way of the cross leads home. (2x)<br/>It is sweet to know, as I onward go,<br/>The way of the cross leads home.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>So I bid farewell to the ways of the world,<br/>To walk in them nevermore.<br/>For He bids me come, and I seek my home,<br/>Where He stands at the open door.</lines>
