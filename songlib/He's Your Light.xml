    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>For the darkness covers the earth,<br/>And gross darkness all the people<br/>But the Lord shall arise upon thee,<br/>And His glory shall be seen upon thee.<br/>He's your light, He's your light,<br/>He will guide you through the darkest night,<br/>He will guide you through the darkest night,<br/>He's your light, and He shines through you and me.<br/>For a thousand shall fall at thy side,<br/>And ten thousand at thy right hand,<br/>But I'm not afraid of the terror by night<br/>Nor the arrow that flies by the day.<br/>He's alive, He's alive,<br/>He has conquered death; we shall do the same!<br/>He has conquered death; we shall do the same!<br/>He's alive, and He lives in you and me!<br/></lines>
