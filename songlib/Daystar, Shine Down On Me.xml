    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Lily of the Valley, let your sweet aroma fill my life.<br/>Rose of Sharon, show me how to grow in beauty in God's sight.<br/>Fairest of ten thousand, make me a reflection of your light.<br/>Daystar, shine down on me. Let your love shine through me in the night.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>Lead me Lord, I'll follow, anywhere you open up the door.<br/>Let your word speak through me; show me what I've never seen before.<br/>Lord, I want to be your witness; you can take what's wrong and make it right.<br/>Daystar, shine down on me. Let your love shine through me in the night.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Lord I've seen a world that's dying, wounded by the master of deceit.<br/>Groping in the darkness, haunted by the years of past defeat.<br/>But when I see you standing near me, shining with compassion in your eyes,<br/>I pray, Jesus, shine down on me. Let your love shine through me in the night.</lines>
