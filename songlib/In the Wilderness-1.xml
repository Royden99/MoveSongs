    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The wilderness is glad for us<br/>Hear the desert rejoice,<br/>For the sounds of joy and singing we bring.<br/>For we can see the glory, the glory of the Lord,<br/>For in the wilderness waters are breaking out!<br/>Strengthen the weak hands, confirm the feeble knees,<br/>Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong!<br/>For streams are flowing in the desert,<br/>Streams are flowing in the desert,<br/>And in the wilderness waters are breaking out!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Now the eyes of the blind are opened<br/>And the ears of the deaf unstopped.<br/>Now the lame can leap,<br/>And the tongue of the dumb can sing.<br/>And in a land so parched and thirsty<br/>Springs of water now abound.<br/>For in the wilderness waters are breaking out!</lines>
