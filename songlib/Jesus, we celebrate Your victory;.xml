    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Jesus, we celebrate Your victory;<br/>Jesus, we revel in Your love.<br/>Jesus, we rejoice You've set us free;<br/>Jesus, Your death has brought us life.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>It was for freedom that Christ set us free,<br/>No longer to be subject to a yoke of slavery;<br/>So we're rejoicing in God's victory,<br/>Our hearts responding to His love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>His Spirit in us releases us from fear,<br/>The way to Him is open, with boldness we draw near,<br/>And in His presence our problems disappear;<br/>Our hearts responding to His love.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
