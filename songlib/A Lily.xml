    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>A lily in the midst of thorns,<br/>The King of kings adorns you.<br/>Your feet are cleansed as you walk,<br/>Loving Him Who found you.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>You are called to do His will<br/>On the land beneath your feet.<br/>The Lord delights in this land;<br/>It is called married.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>A lamb in the midst of wolves,<br/>The Lord of lords surrounds you.<br/>Your feet are cleansed as you walk,<br/>Trusting Him Who found you.<br/></lines>
