    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Sweet honey in the Rock; sweet honey in the Rock<br/>Just like sweet honey in the Rock.<br/>Come taste and see what the Lord has done<br/>For it's just like sweet honey in the Rock.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I heard the voice of Jesus say, Come unto me and rest.<br/>Lie down, lie down, O weary one, your head upon my breast.<br/>I came to Jesus just as I was; I was weary, worn, and sad.<br/>I found in Him a resting place, and He has made me glad.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Amazing grace, how sweet the sound<br/>That saved a wretch like me.<br/>I found in Him a higher ground,<br/>And He has made me glad.</lines>
