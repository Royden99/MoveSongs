    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The world is not my home;<br/>I'm just passing through.<br/>My treasures are laid up, somewhere beyond the blue.<br/>O, the angels beckon me, from heaven's open door,<br/>And I can't feel at home in this world anymore.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>O Lord, You know I have no friend like You;<br/>If heaven's not my home, then, Lord, what would I do?<br/>O, the angels beckon me, from heaven's open door,<br/>And I can't feel at home in this world anymore.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Well, over in glory land, there is no dying there.<br/>There are saints on every hand; there's always time for prayer.<br/>The angels beckon me, from heaven's open door,<br/>And I can't feel at home in this world anymore.</lines>
    </verse>
