      <lines>This is my desire to honor You,<br/>Lord with all my heart I worship You.<br/>All I have within me I give You praise,<br/>All that I adore is in You.<br/>-------------<br/>Lord I give You my heart,<br/>I give You my soul<br/>I live for You alone,<br/>Every breath that I take<br/>Every moment I'm awake<br/>Lord have Your way in me.</lines>
