    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Satan's like a roaring lion,<br/>Roaming to and fro,<br/>Seeking whom he may devour;<br/>The Bible tells me so.<br/>Many souls have been his prey<br/>To fall in some weak hour<br/>But God has promised us today<br/>His overcoming power.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Greater is He that is in me,<br/>Greater is He that is in me,<br/>Greater is He that is in me,<br/>Than he that is in the world.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>On the day of Pentecost<br/>A rushing mighty wind<br/>Blew into the upper room<br/>And baptized all of them<br/>With a power greater than<br/>Any earthly foe<br/>And I'm so glad I've got it too;<br/>I'm gonna let the whole world know.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
