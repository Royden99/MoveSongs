    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Would you be free from your passions and pride?<br/>There's power in the blood, power in the blood;<br/>Come for a cleansing from Calvary's tide,<br/>There's wonderful power in the blood.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Would you be whiter much whiter than snow?<br/>There's power in the blood, power in the blood;<br/>Sin stains are lost in its life-giving flow,<br/>There's wonderful power in the blood.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Would you do service for Jesus your King?<br/>There's power in the blood, power in the blood.<br/>Would you live daily His praises to sing?<br/>There's wonderful power in the blood.<br/></lines>
