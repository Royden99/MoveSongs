    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There's a silent war that's raging within me,<br/>But lo, a nature fights to dominate.<br/>My Spirit man is poised and locked in battle<br/>With this carnal side of me I've learned to hate.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The trumpet of my prayer plays toward heaven,<br/>A voice of desperation in my cry;<br/>Lord, strengthen me that I might not yield myself to<br/>But keep your righteous banner lifted high.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Lord, I hunger for Your holiness,<br/>And I trust for the righteousness that is Yours;<br/>That my mind would be clean, and my spirit renewed,<br/>And this temple that You dwell in would be pure.<br/>The tempter stalks about me as a lion<br/>Searching for the slightest sense of blood.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>For when the skin of my resistance is broken<br/>He moves in swiftly to deepen the cut.<br/>The Lord of creation hear Your servant;<br/>You understand the weakness of man.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>I'm counting myself crucified with Jesus;<br/>Alive with Christ, and dead, indeed, to sin.<br/>Lord, I hunger for holiness,<br/>And I trust for the righteousness that's Yours<br/>That my mind would be clean and my spirit renewed,</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>And this temple that You dwell in,<br/>Yes, this temple that You dwell in,<br/>Lord, I hunger for holiness;</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>And I trust for the righteousness that is Yours;<br/>That my mind would be clean, and my spirit renewed,<br/>And this temple that You dwell in would be pure.<br/>Lord I hunger, Lord, I hunger for holiness,<br/>For holiness.</lines>
