    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>God looks for a people; the faithful and the strong,<br/>To speak to situations, and cause things to be born<br/>Captives of a vision, singers of a song<br/>Who only live to see His kingdom come, (2x)</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The time we have is precious, we have no time to waste<br/>In looking over our shoulder to see who'll take our place<br/>We need to have a vision and not a sense of lack;<br/>We never make decisions if we keep on looking back.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The fields are white with harvest, the laborers are few,<br/>The word comes to the leaders, What now will you do?<br/>Will you sit in introspection, until the coming day,<br/>Or will you rise like young men, and will you lead the way?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>We can't boast of tomorrow, we only have today.<br/>The past lies dead behind us, forgotten along the way;<br/>So let faith rise up among us, to see His kingdom come,<br/>Let us run the race with joy, let's see His will be done.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Will we be that people, or will He pass us by?<br/>Is there no one among us, who will even dare to try?<br/>Or will His zeal consume us, and will our lives be run,<br/>Seeing kingdoms overthrown, In the name of God's own Son.</lines>
    </verse>
