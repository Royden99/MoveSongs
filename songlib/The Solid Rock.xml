    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>On Christ the solid Rock I stand,<br/>All other ground is sinking sand.<br/>All other ground is sinking sand.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>My hope is built on nothing less<br/>Than Jesus' blood and righteousness.<br/>I dare not trust the sweetest frame,<br/>But wholly lean on Jesus' name.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>When darkness seems to hide His face,<br/>I rest on His unchanging grace.<br/>In every high and stormy gale,<br/>My anchor holds within the veil.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>His oath, His covenant, His blood,<br/>Support me in the whelming flood.<br/>When all around my soul gives way,<br/>He then is all my Hope and Stay.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>When He shall come with trumpet sound,<br/>O may I then in Him be found!<br/>Dressed in His righteousness alone,<br/>Faultless to stand before the throne!</lines>
    </verse>
