    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Oh, it's good to know that we<br/>Are finally set free<br/>By the birth of the Father in His sons.<br/>And now we are enjoying<br/>The blessing of His wellspring<br/>As we move in the oneness of His Son.<br/>Chorus:<br/>I've got glory comin' at me from both sides.<br/>I've got glory flowin' over me in tides.<br/>I've got glory shinin' on me like sunshine, it seems<br/>And it's You, my Father, beloved guide.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>We speak His Word throughout the land<br/>As we sit as His right hand<br/>Our names are written in the book with His blood.<br/>As we move in unity,<br/>We shall set the captives free<br/>And we long to hear the words,<br/>Well done my son.</lines>
