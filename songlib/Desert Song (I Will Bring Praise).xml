    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>This is my prayer in the desert,<br/>When all that's within me feels dry.<br/>This is my prayer in my hunger and need:<br/>'My God is the God who provides.'</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>I will bring praise.<br/>I will bring praise.<br/>No weapon formed against me shall remain.<br/>I will rejoice.<br/>I will declare:<br/>'God is my victory and He is here.'</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And this is my prayer in the fire,<br/>In weakness or trial or pain:<br/>'Faith that is proved is<br/>Of more worth than gold,<br/>So refine me, Lord, through the flame.'</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>And this is my prayer in the battle,<br/>When triumph is still on its way:<br/>'I am a conqueror and co-heir with Christ,<br/>So firm on His promise I'll stand.'</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>This is my prayer in the harvest,<br/>When favor and providence flow:<br/>'I know I'm filled to be poured out again.<br/>The seed I've received I will sow.'</lines>
    </verse>
