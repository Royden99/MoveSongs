    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The time we have is precious,<br/>There is no time to waste,<br/>To be looking over shoulders<br/>To see who'll take our place.<br/>We need to have a vision<br/>And not a sense of lack:<br/>For we'll never make decisions<br/>If we keep on looking back.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>God looks for a people,<br/>The faithful and the strong,<br/>Who speak to situations,<br/>Cause things to be born,<br/>Captives of a vision,<br/>Singers of a song,<br/>Who only live to see His kingdom come.<br/>Who only live to see His kingdom come.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The fields are white to harvest,<br/>The labourers are few,<br/>The word comes to the leaders,<br/>What now will you do?<br/>Will you sit in introspection<br/>Until the coming day,<br/>Or will you rise like young men<br/>And will you lead the way?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>We can't boast of tomorrow,<br/>We only have today;<br/>The past lies dead behind us<br/>Forgotten along the way.<br/>Let faith rise up among us,<br/>We'll see His will be done,<br/>As we run this race with joy<br/>To see His kingdom come.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>So will we be that people<br/>Or will He pass us by?<br/>Is there no one among us<br/>Who will even dare to try?<br/>Or will His zeal consume us<br/>Until our lives be one?<br/>To see Satan's kingdom overthrown<br/>In the name of God's own Son.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
