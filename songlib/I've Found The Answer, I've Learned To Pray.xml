    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I've found the answer, I've learned to pray.<br/>With faith to guide me, I've found the way.<br/>The sun is shining for me each day.<br/>I've found the answer, I've learned to pray.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I was weak and weary, I had gone astray.<br/>Walking in the darkness, I could not find my way.<br/>Jesus came and found me, brought new life within,<br/>Led me out of darkness, and took away my sins.</lines>
