    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>It's your heart; it's your heart;<br/>It's your heart in this matter that counts, O My Son.<br/>It's your heart; it's your heart;<br/>It's your heart in this matter that counts, O My Son.<br/>So let your windows of heaven all be opened again<br/>And be healed by His wonderful love. (Repeat.)</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Many things you can see <br/>Will take your eyes off of Me<br/>Many windows there are to draw you so far <br/>Away from what the Lord <br/>Would have you to be, <br/>So let your windows of heaven <br/>Be opened again.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>So be careful as you choose, <br/>And you'll be sure not lose <br/>Your new found sight of <br/>My purpose as I deal so with you.<br/>As you keep your heart right <br/>You will see with new sight <br/>And your windows of heaven <br/>Will be opened again</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Some did look through a window <br/>To judge and to scorn, <br/>Another sat in his window <br/>And after death was reborn,<br/>But there's a window that's above, <br/>and as you choose to live and love, <br/>That blessed window of heaven <br/>Will be opened again.</lines>
