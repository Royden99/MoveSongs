    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I've been redeemed, by the blood of the Lamb.<br/>I've been redeemed, by the blood of the Lamb.<br/>I've been redeemed, by the blood of the Lamb.<br/>Filled with the Holy Ghost I am.<br/>All my sins are washed away; I've been redeemed.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And that's not all, there's more besides. (3x)<br/>I've been to the river and I've been baptised.<br/>All my sins are washed away; I've been redeemed.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>You can talk about me just as much as you please. (3x)<br/>I'll talk about you down on my knees. <br/>All my sins are washed away; I've been redeemed.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>There's a little seed in you and me. (3x)<br/>Growing up to incorruptibility.<br/>All my sins are washed away; I've been redeemed.</lines>
