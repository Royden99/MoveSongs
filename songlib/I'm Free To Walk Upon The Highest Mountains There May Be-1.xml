    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I'm free to walk upon the highest mountains there may be.<br/>I'm free to place my feet upon the land and on the sea.<br/>I'm free to manifest the very image that I am,<br/>I'm free but I'm not loose in His kingdom I now stand.<br/>So good to be free! No earthly kingdom has a hold on me.<br/>My heavenly Father, He dwells in me.<br/>O, praise the Lord! It's good to be free.</lines>
