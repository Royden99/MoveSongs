    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>My God watches over me;<br/>He sees me in my time of trouble,<br/>And He shelters me in the time of storms<br/>That try to cloud my way.<br/>He leads me through night, to show me the day,<br/>For You are Lord,<br/>For You are Lord,<br/>For You are Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>You are faithful; You are true,<br/>My Rock and my Salvation.<br/>Great and wondrous are Thy ways,<br/>Teach me Thy ways, O Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And I will walk in Thy truth,<br/>For You are God, (3x)<br/>And God alone.</lines>
