      <lines>Lord, I love You, I earnestly seek You.<br/>Only You can reign in my heart. (Repeat.)<br/>You are the One who saved my soul.<br/>You are the One who makes me whole.<br/>You are the Lord of my life, and I exalt You.<br/>You shelter me in Your mighty hand.<br/>You are the Rock on which I stand.<br/>You are the Lord, You are the one.</lines>
