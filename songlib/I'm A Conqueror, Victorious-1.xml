    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>For He strengthens me, He strengthens me<br/>With joy in my heart and peace in my soul<br/>He strengthens me<br/>Oh, I'm a conqueror, reigning with Him<br/>Secure in the blood of Jesus<br/>That cleanses me from sin.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I'm a conqueror, victorious. <br/>I'm reigning with Jesus. <br/>I'm seated, in heavenly places, <br/>With Him, with Him.<br/>For the kingdom of God is within me. <br/>I know no defeat, only victory. <br/>For the kingdom of God is within me. <br/>I know no defeat, only strength and power.</lines>
