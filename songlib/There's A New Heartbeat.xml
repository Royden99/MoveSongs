      <lines>There's a new heartbeat<br/>Coming from this nation,<br/>A new heartbeat, tuned in to creation,<br/>A new heartbeat, coming from every street.<br/>It's steady in its cry for the Sons to be released,<br/>Steady in its cry for the Sons to be released,<br/>Steady in its cry for the Sons to be released,<br/>Steady in its cry for the Sons to be released...</lines>
