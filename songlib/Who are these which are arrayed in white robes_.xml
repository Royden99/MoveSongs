    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Who are these which are arrayed in white robes?<br/>Who are these and from where do they come?<br/>These are they who came out,   (2x)<br/>These are they who came out of great tribulation,<br/>And they have washed their robes and made them white,  (2x)<br/>They have washed their robes, <br/>And made them white<br/>In the blood of the Lamb.</lines>
