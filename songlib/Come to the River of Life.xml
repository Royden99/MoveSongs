    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Come to the river of life,<br/>You will find healing here;<br/>Come to the river of life,<br/>Come and drink freely here,<br/>Come, if your heart is searching,<br/>Come, if your soul is thirsty,<br/>Draw near and drink<br/>Of the mercy of Jesus Christ<br/>At the river of life.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>There is a river whose streams<br/>Make glad the city of God,<br/>The city of God;<br/>So come if you're wounded or sad,<br/>There is a river,<br/>There is a river.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>It flows from the land<br/>Of eternal light<br/>Where there's no more sorrow<br/>And no more night<br/>Into the hearts<br/>That are lifted to Him,<br/>Filling His children<br/>Again and again.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
