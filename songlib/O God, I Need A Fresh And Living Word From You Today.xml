      <lines>Chorus:<br/>O God, I need a fresh and living Word from You today.<br/>Please O Lord, don't let me miss a word that You might say.<br/>I'm praying Lord, O let me see, O let me be<br/>Alive in Thee-completely free,<br/>I need Thee constantly.</lines>

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The Israelites received each day fresh manna from the Lord,<br/>The gathering was daily thing, and it could not be stored.<br/>Fresh manna every day by the Word of God's command<br/>Kept all Israel fed until they reached the promised land.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There were ten virgins going to wedding feast one night.<br/>Five of them were wise and brought some oil for their light.<br/>The other five were foolish, went to buy some, so they thought.<br/>When they returned, He closed the door and said, I know you not.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Where are you today? Are things all going wrong,<br/>Are you feeling weak while the enemy seems strong?<br/>It sure has been a problem how such lies can fill our minds,<br/>But Christ brings us victory, the rest is left behind.</lines>
