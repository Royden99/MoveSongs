    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>It is no secret what God can do.<br/>What He's done for others, He'll do for you.<br/>With arms wide open, He'll pardon you.<br/>It is no secret what God can do.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The chimes of time ring out the news,<br/>Another day is through.<br/>Someone slipped and fell.<br/>Was that someone you?<br/>You may have longed for added strength,<br/>Your courage to renew.<br/>Do not be disheartened,<br/>For I have news for you.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There is no night for in His light<br/>You never walk alone.<br/>Always feel at home,<br/>Wherever you may go.<br/>There is no power can conquer you<br/>While God is on your side.<br/>Take Him at His promise,<br/>Don't run away and hide.</lines>
    </verse>
