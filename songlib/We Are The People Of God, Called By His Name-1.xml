    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We are the people of God, called by His name. <br/>Called from the dark, and delivered from shame.<br/>One holy race, saints everyone, <br/>Because of the blood of Christ, Jesus the Son.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>With our lips let us sing one confession. <br/>With our hearts hold to one truth alone. <br/>He has erased our transgressions. <br/>Claimed us and called us His own, His very own.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Hear us O spirits of darkness, <br/>so you will know where we stand.<br/>We are His servants, purchased with scars, <br/>Bought by the blood of the Lamb,<br/>The blood of the Lamb.</lines>
