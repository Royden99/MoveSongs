    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>If you're walking through the valley,<br/>And there are shadows all around,<br/>Do not fear, He will guide You,<br/>He will keep you safe and sound.<br/>He has promised to never leave you<br/>Nor forsake you, and His Word is true.<br/>God is good all the time,<br/>He put a song of praise in this heart of mine;<br/>God is good, all the time.<br/>Through the darkest night, His light will shine;<br/>God is good, God is good all the time.<br/>Though I may not understand<br/>All the plans You have for me,<br/>My life is in Your hands,<br/>And through the eyes of faith<br/>I can clearly see.<br/>We were sinners so unworthy,<br/>Still for us He chose to die;<br/>Filled us with His Holy Spirit,<br/>Now we can stand and testify<br/>That His love is everlasting<br/>And His mercies, they will never end.<br/></lines>
