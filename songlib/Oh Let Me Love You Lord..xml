    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Blessed Amazing Grace<br/>Blessed amazing grace<br/>Saved by His sacrifice<br/>He purchased for me a place<br/>And a name in the Book of Life<br/>Pure and unchanging love<br/>That rescued my wretched soul<br/>He gave me new life from above<br/>As He's touched and made me whole</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Oh, let me love you Lord<br/>The way that you love me<br/>All that I am, all that I can<br/>All I will ever be<br/>Now and forever<br/>Now and for always<br/>Let all that I do<br/>Bring glory to you<br/>Honor and praise</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Mercy that lifted me up<br/>To a life lived within the veil<br/>He bade me to drink from a cup<br/>Drawn from a living well. <br/>Robes that have been washed white<br/>And a joy that's unspeakable<br/>You've taken my widow's mite<br/>And returned twelve baskets full.</lines>
