    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O, there's joy deep down, flowing like a river,<br/>Flowing like the river of the Lord.<br/>O, there's joy deep down, flowing out from holy ground.<br/>O, there's joy like the river of the Lord.<br/>Chorus:<br/>So let it flow (Ladies),<br/>From the mountains (Men),<br/>Let it flow (Ladies),<br/>Down to the sea (Men).<br/>Like a river of living waters flowing out from you and me,<br/>Like the new and living way from deep within the veil,<br/>Let it flow. Let it flow.<br/>Oh, let it flow, like the river of the Lord.</lines>
