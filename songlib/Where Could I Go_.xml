    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Where could I go? Oh, where could I go?<br/>Seeking a refuge for my soul?<br/>Needing a friend to help me in the end,<br/>Where could I go but to the Lord?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Living below in this old sinful world,<br/>Hardly a comfort can afford,<br/>Striving alone to face temptation's call,<br/>Where could I go but to the Lord?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Neighbors are fun; I love 'em everyone.<br/>We get along in sweet accord.<br/>But when I pass the chilling hand of death,<br/>Where could I go but to the Lord?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Life here is grand with friends I love so well.<br/>Comfort I get from God's own word.<br/>But when my soul needs manna from above,<br/>Where could I go but to the Lord?</lines>
    </verse>
