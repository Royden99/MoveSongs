    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He's under my feet.<br/>He's under my feet.<br/>Now my victory is complete.<br/>Jesus spoiled principalities,<br/>Made a show of them openly.<br/>He's under my feet, he's under my feet.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Love never gives up, never gives up, never gives up.<br/>Love never gives up, never gives up, never gives up.<br/>Love never gives up, never gives up, never gives up.<br/>Love never gives up, till I am holy and set free.</lines>
