      <lines>Happy is the people that is in such a case  (x3)<br/>Whose God is the Lord.<br/>That our sons may be as plants grown up,<br/>That our daughters may be as cornerstones,<br/>That our garners may be full,<br/>That our oxen may be strong,<br/>And there be no complaining in our streets,<br/>Hallelujah!<br/>Happy is the people that is in such a case,  x3<br/>Whose God is the Lord.<br/></lines>
