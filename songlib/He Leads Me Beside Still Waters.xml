    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>He leads me beside still waters<br/>Somewhere in the valley below.<br/>He draws me aside<br/>To be tested and tried,<br/>But in the valley He restoreth my soul.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When I'm low in spirit<br/>I cry, Lord, lift me up.<br/>I want to go higher with Thee.<br/>But the Lord knows I can't live on the mountain.<br/>So He picked out a valley for me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>It's dark as a dungeon<br/>And the sun doesn't shine,<br/>And I question, Lord, why must this be?<br/>Then He tells me to stand in my sorrow,<br/>That the victory's in trials for me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I know now in my spirit<br/>I can rejoice in every trial,<br/>Knowing my Lord is delivering me.<br/>He says, My Son, the Work's already done,<br/>And My grace is sufficient for thee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>The battles may be hard<br/>And the way may not be easy.<br/>He never said it would be.<br/>But now I know why I have the valleys<br/>So Christ could come forth in me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>So when you're in a valley<br/>And it seems too hard to climb<br/>To the mountain top above,<br/>Just remember you're the hope of creation.<br/>In the valley you'll come forth in love.</lines>
    </verse>
