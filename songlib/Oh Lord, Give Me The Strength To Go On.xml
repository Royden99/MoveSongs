    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Oh Lord, give me the strength to go on.<br/>Oh Lord, give me the power to overcome.<br/>Help me to go through the Day of Atonement.<br/>Let me see the joy ahead.<br/>Help me to lay down my life,<br/>that I might come forth from the dead.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Oh Lord, I pray that I might not compromise.<br/>Help me to lay all selfishness aside.<br/>Let me see that these afflictions are doing a work in me.<br/>And when the work is complete, we shall set all creation free.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Oh Lord, you have chosen us to be that company<br/>That will blow the trumpet for the year of jubilee.<br/>But first we must suffer, become obedient in all things.<br/>And then we shall reign with Jesus the King of Kings.</lines>
