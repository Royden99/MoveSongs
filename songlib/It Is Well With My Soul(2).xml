    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When peace like a river attendeth my way,<br/>When sorrows like sea billows roll;<br/>Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,<br/>It is well, it is well with my soul.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>It is well (it is well), with my soul (with my soul)<br/>It is well, it is well with my soul.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,<br/>Let this blest assurance control<br/>That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate<br/>And has shed His own blood for my soul.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>My sin - oh the bliss of this glorious thought -<br/>My sin, not in part, but the whole<br/>Is nailed to His cross, and I bear it no more;<br/>Praise to the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live!<br/>If Jordan above me shall roll,<br/>No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life<br/>Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>But Lord, 'tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait,<br/>The sky, not the grave, is our goal<br/>Oh, trump of the angel!  Oh, voice of the Lord!<br/>Blessed hope!  Blessed rest of my soul.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,<br/>The clouds be rolled back as a scroll.<br/>The trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend,<br/>Even so, it is well with my soul.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
