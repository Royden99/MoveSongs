    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We are being built into a temple<br/>Fit for God's own dwelling place <br/>Into the house of God, which is the church<br/>The pillar and the ground of truth<br/>As precious stones that Jesus owns<br/>Fashioned by His love and grace<br/>And as we learn to trust each other<br/>So the building grows and grows.</lines>
