    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Amazing grace, how sweet the sound <br/>           That saved a wretch like me, I once was lost, <br/>           But now am found, was blind but now I see.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear<br/>           And grace my fears relieved<br/>           How precious did that grace appear<br/>           The hour I first believed</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>My chains are gone, I've been set free<br/>My God, My Saviour has ransomed me<br/>and like a flood his mercy reigns<br/>unending love amazing grace</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>The Lord has promised good to me<br/>His word my hope secures<br/>He will my shield and portion be <br/>As long as life endures</lines>
