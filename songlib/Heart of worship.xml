    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When the music fades, and all is stripped away and I simply come<br/>Longing just to bring, something that's of worth<br/>That will bless Your heart</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I'll bring you more than a song, for a song in itself<br/>     Is not what You have required<br/>    You search much deeper within, through the way things appear<br/>    You're looking into my heartâ€¦</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I'm coming back to the heart of worship<br/>	And it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus<br/>   	I'm sorry Lord for the things I've made it<br/>	When it's all about You , it's all about You, Jesus</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>King of endless worth, no once could express<br/>How much you deserve.  Though I'm weak and poor<br/>And all I have is yours, every single breath</lines>
