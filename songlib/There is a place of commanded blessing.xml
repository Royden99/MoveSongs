    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There is a place of commanded blessing<br/>Where brethren in unity dwell,<br/>A place where anointing oil is flowing,<br/>Where we live as one.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>You have called us to be a body,<br/>You have called us as friends,<br/>Joined together in the bond of the Spirit<br/>Unto the end.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Father, we join in the prayer of Jesus,<br/>As You are, so let us be one,<br/>Joined together in unity and purpose,<br/>All for the love of Your Son.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>We will break dividing walls,<br/>We will break dividing walls,<br/>We will break dividing walls in the name of Your Son.<br/>We will break dividing walls,<br/>We will break dividing walls, and we will be one.<br/></lines>
