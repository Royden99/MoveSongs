    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The Lord love the gates of Zion.<br/>He dwells in her courts of praise,<br/>In them are stirring.<br/>The songs of deliverance.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Walk all around her,<br/>Go through her palaces.<br/>Inscribe what you see <br/>In the hearts of your children.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>My lines are in pleasant places,<br/>Oh say to the Lord,<br/>My heritage is beautiful to me,<br/>Is beautiful to me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Glorious things are spoken.<br/>Oh city of our great King,<br/>God in his Temple<br/>Is known as a stronghold.</lines>
