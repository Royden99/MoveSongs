    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Acres of diamonds, mountains of gold,<br/>Rivers of silver, treasures untold,<br/>All put together couldn't buy you and me<br/>A heart that's contented, or a spirit that's free.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Peace when you're troubled, a satisfied mind,<br/>These are the treasures that money can't buy.</lines>
