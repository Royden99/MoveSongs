    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Search me, O my Lord, and cleanse me from my sin,<br/>Wash me thoroughly, from my iniquity<br/>And I shall be whiter than the snow.<br/>Where thou leadest me, Lord, will I go.<br/>I want to soar in the heavenlies,<br/>Desire Your truth to be worked in me<br/>Until the day You're revealed in me,<br/>Until the day You're revealed in me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Refiner's fire must come to burn away the dross<br/>Until the day is here of the revealing of His sons.<br/>And on that day Jehovah shall say,<br/>"I do delight in your sacrifice.<br/>I take pleasure in those who have won,<br/>Did not shrink back when they heard of the price"<br/>And on that day I will rule with Him,<br/>And on that day I will rule with Him.<br/></lines>
