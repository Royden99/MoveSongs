    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>As the river flows into the sea and loses its identity.<br/>That's how it is with you and me, in Christ.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>As the mountains tall, rise into the sky,<br/>so the Lord has called forth you and I,<br/>to rise to greater heights, to make us pure in Christ.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>As the mountains tall, and the rivers deep, we'll move with God.<br/>We will not sleep. Until the day, when we hear Him say,<br/>My glory is on you to stay.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>As the river flows into the sea and loses its identity.<br/>That's how it is with you and me, in Christ.</lines>
