      <lines>Well, I wouldn't take nothing for my journey now<br/>I'm going to make it to heaven some how <br/>Even though the devil tempts me and he tries to turn me around. <br/>Well he's offered everything that's got a name<br/>All the wealth I want and the worldly fame.<br/>If I could, still I wouldn't take nothing for my journey now.</lines>
