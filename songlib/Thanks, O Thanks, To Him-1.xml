    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Sin took charge when Adam fell<br/>Rewarding men win with death and hell<br/>For sin came and death upon all men had passed. <br/>Then into the world came God's own son<br/>He fought with sin and Jesus won<br/>Now man may be free from sin at last. </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>Thanks, oh thanks to him.<br/>I need never, ever sin.<br/>For Jesus, by one sacrifice<br/>For me forever paid the price,<br/>And now I have the sinless Christ within.<br/>Thanks to him I need never, ever sin.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Jesus claimed he wasn't good<br/>Strove against sin unto blood<br/>And as a man, he showed what man could do. <br/>Now he has a name above all names.<br/>He gives us power to do the same,<br/>The overcoming power of Christ the king. </lines>
