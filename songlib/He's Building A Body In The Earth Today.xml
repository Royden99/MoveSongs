    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He's building a body in the earth today.<br/>He's building a body and it's not of clay.<br/>A spiritual body for the glory of God,<br/>He's building a body in the earth today.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Find your place in the body in the earth today.<br/>Get in to God's order and learn to obey.<br/>The death to self message will show you the way.<br/>To get into the body in the earth today.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>We're singing a new song in the earth today.<br/>We're singing a new song and it's not for pay.<br/>It's Christ in His body. It's Jesus the Head.<br/>It's on to perfection. It's raising the dead.</lines>
