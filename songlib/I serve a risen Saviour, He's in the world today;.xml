    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I serve a risen Saviour, He's in the world today;<br/>I know that He is living whatever men may say;<br/>I see His hand of mercy, I hear His voice of cheer,<br/>And just the time I need Him, He's always near.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He lives, He lives,<br/>Christ Jesus lives today!<br/>He walks with me and talks with me<br/>Along life's narrow way.<br/>He lives, He lives,<br/>Salvation to impart!<br/>You ask me how I know He lives?<br/>He lives within my heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>In all the world around me I see His loving care,<br/>And though my heart grows weary I never will despair;<br/>I know that He is leading through all the stormy blast,<br/>The day of His appearing will come at last.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Rejoice, rejoice, O christian, lift up your voice and sing<br/>Eternal hallelujahs to Jesus Christ the King!<br/>The hope of all who seek Him, the help of all who find,<br/>None other is so loving, so good and kind.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
