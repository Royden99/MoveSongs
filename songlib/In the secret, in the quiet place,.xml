    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In the secret, in the quiet place,<br/>In the stillness, You are there.<br/>In the secret, in the quiet hour,<br/>I will wait for You,<br/>'Cause I want to know You more.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I want to know You,<br/>I want to hear Your voice,<br/>I want to know You more.<br/>I want to touch You,<br/>I want to see Your face,<br/>I want to know You more.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I am reaching for the highest goal<br/>That I might receive the prize.<br/>Pressing onward,<br/>Pushing every hindrance aside,<br/>Out of my way,<br/>'Cause I want to know You more.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
