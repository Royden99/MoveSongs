    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When I walk through the doors <br/>I sensed His presence <br/>And I knew this was a place where love abounds<br/>For this is a temple the God we love abides here <br/>Oh we are standing in His presence on holy ground</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>We are standing on holy ground <br/>And I know that there are angels all around <br/>Let us praise Jesus now <br/>we are standing in His presence on holy ground</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>In His presence  there<br/>is joy beyond all measure<br/>And at His feet sweet peace of mind can still be found <br/>For when we have a need He is still the answer <br/>Reach out and claim it for we are standing on holy ground</lines>
    </verse>
