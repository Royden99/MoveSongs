      <lines>Chorus<br/>Teach me to dance to the beat of Your heart.<br/>Teach me to move in the power of Your Spirit.<br/>Teach me to walk in the light of Your presence.<br/>Teach me to dance to the beat of Your heart.<br/>Teach me to love with Your heart of compassion.<br/>Teach me to trust in the word of Your promise.<br/>Teach me to hope in the day of Your coming.<br/>Teach me to dance to the beat of Your heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>You wrote the rhythm of life,<br/>Created heaven and earth;<br/>In You is joy without measure.<br/>So like a child in Your sight,<br/>I dance to see Your delight,<br/>For I was made for Your pleasure, pleasure.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Let all my movements express<br/>A heart that loves to say 'yes',<br/>A will that leaps to obey You.<br/>Let all my energy blaze<br/>To see the joy in Your face,<br/>Let my whole being praise You.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Teach me to dance to the beat of Your heart.<br/>Teach me to dance to the beat of Your heart.<br/>Teach me, teach me to dance.<br/>Teach me, teach me to dance.<br/>Teach me, teach me to dance.<br/>Teach me, teach me to dance.<br/></lines>
