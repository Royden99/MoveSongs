    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Jesus came and He lived and then He gave it all up for me.<br/>He is the prophecy of the manchild of liberty.<br/>He gave all that He had, and that's how I'd like to be.<br/>For the Lord doesn't want my talents, He wants me.<br/>Without a wrinkle or spot He wants me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He said, Sell all you have and follow me.<br/>That's what you've got to do;<br/>And daily bear your cross, you're a chosen few.<br/>If you take what the world has to offer, you're going to lose.<br/>For the Lord doesn't want your treasures, He wants you.<br/>Without a wrinkle or spot He wants you.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>He is faithful to His promises unto you.<br/>He is a holy God of righteousness and truth.<br/>He's going to make the perfect manchild out of you.<br/>And the Lord shall fulfill His purpose, He'll have you.<br/>Without a wrinkle or spot He'll have you.</lines>
