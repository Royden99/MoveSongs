    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He took the chains from my heart and set me free.<br/>He gave me joy, now I'm happy as can be.<br/>He brought me out of sinking sand.<br/>Placed my feet on higher ground.<br/>He took the chains from my heart and set me free.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He took the chains from my feet and set me free.<br/>He gives me strength now I'm walking perfectly.<br/>He took me out of Satan's hand,<br/>Set me in the promised land.<br/>He took the chains from my feet and set me free.</lines>
