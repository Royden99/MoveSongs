    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise,<br/>The city of our God, the holy place,<br/>The joy of the whole earth.<br/>Great is the Lord in Whom we have the victory,<br/>He aids us against the enemy,<br/>We bow down on our knees.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And Lord, we want to lift Your name on high,<br/>And Lord, we want to thank You,<br/>For the works You've done in our lives;<br/>And Lord, we trust in Your unfailing love,<br/>For You alone are God eternal,<br/>Throughout earth and heaven above.<br/></lines>
