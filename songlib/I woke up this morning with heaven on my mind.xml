    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I woke up this morning with heaven on my mind<br/>And glory in my soul;<br/>The Spirit of the Lord was filling me,<br/>Making hallelujahs roll.<br/>I feel that I could just run and run<br/>For miles on down that road;<br/>And if you move over just a little bit,<br/>I'll help you carry your load.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>If you move over just a little bit,<br/>I'll give you a helping hand;<br/>Although the way is rough and steep,<br/>Together we can stand.<br/>I know just what you've been going through,<br/>I've been down that same old road;<br/>And if you move over just a little bit,<br/>I'll help you carry your load.<br/></lines>
