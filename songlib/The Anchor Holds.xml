    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I have journeyed<br/>Through the long dark night<br/>Out on the open sea<br/>By faith alone<br/>Sight unknown<br/>And yet his eyes were watching me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>The anchor holds<br/>Though the ship is battered<br/>The anchor holds<br/>Though the sails are torn<br/>I have fallen on my knees<br/>As I faced the raging seas<br/>The anchor holds<br/>In spite of the storm</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I've had visions<br/>I've had dreams<br/>I've even held them in my hand<br/>But I never knew<br/>They would slip right through<br/>Like they were only grains of sand</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I have been young<br/>But I am older now<br/>And there has been beauty these eyes have seen<br/>But it was in the night<br/>Through the storms of my life<br/>Oh that's where God proved his love to me</lines>
    </verse>
