    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When a man loves the Lord he loves mercy<br/>When a man loves the Lord he gives grace<br/>He is generous and kind<br/>He is peaceful of mind<br/>When a man truly loves the Lord<br/>When a man loves the Lord he acts justly<br/>When a man loves the Lord he is fair<br/>His compassion flows free for the poor and the weak<br/>When a man truly loves the Lord</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I want to be more like Jesus<br/>Show me where I should begin<br/>Teach me to pray and to walk in His ways<br/>And to turn my back on all my sin</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>When a man loves the Lord he walks humbly<br/>When a man loves the Lord he is meek<br/>He is willing to die to his old sinful pride<br/>When a man truly loves the Lord<br/></lines>
    </verse>
