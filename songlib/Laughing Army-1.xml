    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>See the laughing army<br/>Dancing in the streets.<br/>Signing out the battle cry<br/>With a tambourine.<br/>For the time has now arrived<br/>To possess our land<br/>And proclaim to all the world,<br/>His kingdom is at hand. For...<br/>Chorus:<br/>We shall never be the same again.<br/>The army of God has taken over the land.<br/>The kings of this world are now the kings of our God.<br/>They rule and reign forever.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Se the laughing army<br/>Sounding out the call.<br/>For the sons to rally<br/>to see the final fall,<br/>Of the great whore Babylon,<br/>And her earthly kings<br/>That will never rise again<br/>The laughing army sings. That...</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>See the laughing army<br/>Sweeping through the earth<br/>As the nation Israel<br/>Quickly comes to birth.<br/>Fighting as His warriors<br/>Ten thousand prophets strong,<br/>With the weapons of their God<br/>A lauging army song. That...</lines>
