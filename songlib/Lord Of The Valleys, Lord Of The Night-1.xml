    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Lord of the valleys, Lord of the night: <br/>A people in darkness have seen a great light! <br/>So we sing in the darkness, we sing in the night. <br/>Our song drives away all the birds of the night.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Lord of the valleys, Lord of the night: <br/>A people in hiding offer hearts prepared to fight.<br/>So we sing in the darkness, we sing as we fight. <br/>Our song pierces through all the voices of the night.</lines>
