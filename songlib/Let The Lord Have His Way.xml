    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Do you have a problem, and there's no way out?<br/>And you need God's help; there's no doubt?<br/>Then I say, rejoice, for God has been good to you.<br/>For now, He may show you what He can do.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>Let the Lord have His way.<br/>Let the Lord have His way.<br/>Well, all you've gotta do is pray,<br/>Let the Lord have his way. (Repeat).</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Is there someone you love who is so close to you,<br/>And you've tried to help, but you can't get through?<br/>Well are you willing to trust that one into God's own hands?<br/>You know the weakness of God is stronger than man.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Would you dare to ask for an impossibility?<br/>Could you believe for that which could never be?<br/>All things are possible to him who believes.<br/>And Jesus said, Ask and you shall receive.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Above all we ask or think, God is able to do.<br/>His promises are sure, and His word is true.<br/>So if you'd like to see a miracle every day,<br/>All you've got to do is pray,<br/>Let the Lord have his way.</lines>
