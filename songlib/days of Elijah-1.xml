    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>These are the days of Elijah,<br/>Declaring the word of the Lord:<br/>And these are the days of Your servant Moses,<br/>Righteousness being restored.<br/>And though these are days of great trial,<br/>Of famine and darkness and sword,<br/>Still, we are the voice in the desert crying<br/>'Prepare ye the way of the Lord!'</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Behold He comes riding on the clouds,<br/>Shining like the sun at the trumpet call;<br/>Lift your voice; it's the year of jubilee,<br/>And out of Zion's hill salvation comes.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>These are the days of Ezekiel,<br/>The dry bones becoming as flesh;<br/>And these are the days of Your servant David,<br/>Rebuilding a temple of praise.<br/>These are the days of the harvest,<br/>The fields are as white in Your world,<br/>And we are the labourers in Your vineyard,<br/>Declaring the word of the Lord!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>There's no God like Jehovah.<br/>There's no God like Jehovah!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>There's no God like Jehovah.<br/>There's no God like Jehovah!<br/></lines>
