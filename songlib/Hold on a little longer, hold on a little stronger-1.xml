    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Hold on a little longer, hold on a little stronger<br/>The testings of the Lord are pure as gold<br/>He may take you through the fire, but He'll burn out dross and mire<br/>So, hold on a little longer, hold on.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>You took the hand of Jesus, and stood upon His promise<br/>It seems you have trusted in vain<br/>But the answer you have prayed for<br/>is on its way and is paid for.<br/>So, hold on a little longer, hold on.</lines>
