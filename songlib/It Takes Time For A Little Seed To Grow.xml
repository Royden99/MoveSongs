    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>It takes time for a little seed to grow.<br/>It takes time for a little tree to grow.<br/>It takes time for the fruit to come forth.<br/>It takes time; it takes a little time for life to grow.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Spend a little time in fellowship with the Lord.<br/>Spend a little time in prayer on your knees.<br/>Spend a little time in reading God's Word.<br/>It takes time; it takes a little time for life to grow.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And in God's time the little seed will grow.<br/>And in God's time the little tree will grow.<br/>And in God's time the fruit will come forth.<br/>And God's time, God's perfect time, life will come forth.</lines>
