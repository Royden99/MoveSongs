  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I was sinking deep in sin, far from the peaceful shore,<br/>Very deeply stained within, sinking to rise no more,<br/>But the Master of the sea heard my despairing cry,<br/>From the waters lifted me, now safe am I.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>Love lifted me!<br/>Love lifted me!<br/>When nothing else could help,<br/>Love lifted me! (2x)</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>All my heart to Him I give, ever to Him I’ll cling,<br/>In His blessed presence live, ever His praises sing,<br/>Love so mighty and so true, merits my soul’s best songs,<br/>Faithful, loving service, too, to Him belongs.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Souls in danger, look above, Jesus completely saves,<br/>He will lift you by His love, out of the angry waves;<br/>He’s the Master of the sea, billows His will obey,<br/>He your Savior wants to be, be saved today.</lines>
    </verse>
