    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Many valleys ahead to walk through<br/>Many mountains and hills to be climbed. <br/>Through the darkness I cry<br/>For the help of the Most High. <br/>I need Thy strength, I need Thy life to see me through.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Through the tests, through the trials,<br/> Through every dark mile, in the depths of despair, <br/>  I the Lord am always there, and in the valley be still <br/> And wait, for I shall fill thee<br/> With new strength and new courage to press on all the way.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Many shakings ahead to stand through, <br/>Many testings and trials to endure. <br/>And though some fall away, O Lord keep me in Thy way.<br/> I need Thy strength, I need Thy life to see me through.</lines>
