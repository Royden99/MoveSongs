    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He's my Rock, my Sword, my Shield.<br/>He's the Wheel in the middle of the wheel.<br/>He's the Lily of the Valley,<br/>The Bright and Morning Star.<br/>It makes no difference what they say;<br/>I'm gonna trust Him as I pray,<br/>And I'll wait, wait right here until He comes.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>We're His church, His word revealed.<br/>We are walking in God's will.<br/>We're His pearl of great price,<br/>His city on a hill.<br/>It makes no difference what we see;<br/>With God's word we do agree.<br/>He's the Truth, He's the Way into life.</lines>
