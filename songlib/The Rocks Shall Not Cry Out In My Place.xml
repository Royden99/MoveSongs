    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The rocks shall not cry out in my place.<br/>As long as I have breath to lift my voice and give Him praise,<br/>As long as I can make a joyful noise,<br/>I'll sing and shout.<br/>And never let the rocks cry out.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>For joy is mine; I will lift my voice.<br/>I've got every reason under heaven to rejoice.<br/>The God I serve is great, exalted high above the earth.<br/>All creation shall declare it, but I've got to praise Him first.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>O, praise to God; glory to His name.<br/>He is so far above our ways that I cannot explain.<br/>If He gave all His love to me, unfailing and unearned,<br/>The rocks are going to praise Him,<br/>But they'll have to wait their turn.</lines>
    </verse>
