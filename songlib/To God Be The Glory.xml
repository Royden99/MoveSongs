    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>To God be the glory,<br/>To God be the glory,<br/>To God be the glory for the things He has done.<br/>With His blood He has saved me,<br/>With His power He has raised me,<br/>To God be the glory for the things He has done.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>How can I say thanks<br/>For the things You have done for me?<br/>Things so undeserved, yet You gave<br/>To prove Your love for me;<br/>The voices of a million angels<br/>Could not express my gratitude.<br/>All that I am and ever hope to be,<br/>I owe it all to Thee.<br/>To God ...</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Just let me live my life,<br/>Let it be pleasing, Lord, to Thee,<br/>And should I gain any praise,<br/>Let it go to Calvary,<br/>With His blood, He has saved me,<br/>with His power, He has raised me,<br/>To God be the glory for the things He has done.<br/></lines>
