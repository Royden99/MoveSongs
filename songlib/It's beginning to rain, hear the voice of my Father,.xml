    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>It's beginning to rain, hear the voice of my Father,<br/>Saying, "Whosoever will, come drink of this water;<br/>I will pour out My Spirit on your sons and your daughters";<br/>If you're thirsty and dry, lift your hands to the sky,<br/>It's beginning to rain.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>It's beginning to shine, the day-star is rising,<br/>In the hearts and souls of men, in Jesus abiding.<br/>You're a light on a hill, there can be no hiding;<br/>If you walk in the night, reach out for the light,<br/>It's beginning to shine.<br/></lines>
