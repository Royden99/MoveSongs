    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>You opened the gate to a brand new  life<br/>	When I came to the altar.<br/>	You opened the door and Your Spirit,<br/>	Filled me through and through.<br/>	But now my heart still longs for something deeper.<br/>	And I can see light<br/>	Through a veil that You have torn in two.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I want to break through. <br/>I want to break through, <br/>To know as I'm known to know You alone.<br/> I want to break through, <br/>To where no sin can stand in the way. <br/>Let me enter in with boldness I pray. <br/>O show me Thy glory, show me Thy way.<br/> I want to break through.</lines>
