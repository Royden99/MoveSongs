    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He's setting me free with the Holy Ghost power,<br/>He's setting me free this very hour;<br/>Deep down in my soul He's making me whole,<br/>He's setting me free, free, free<br/>With the Holy Ghost power.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He's giving me life with the Holy Ghost power,<br/>He's giving me life this very hour;<br/>He's down in my spirit, now devil you hear it!<br/>He's giving me life, life, life<br/>With the Holy Ghost power.<br/></lines>
