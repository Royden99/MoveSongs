      <lines>I keep falling in love with Him<br/>Over and over and over and over again.<br/>I keep falling in love with Him<br/>Over and over and over and over again.<br/>He gets sweeter and sweeter as the days go by.<br/>Oh, what a love between my Lord and I.<br/>I keep falling in love with Him<br/>Over and over and over and over again.</lines>
