    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When we all get together in the Lord,<br/>When we all get together in the Lord,<br/>We will treat one another like sister and brother<br/>When we all get together in the Lord. </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When the family gets together in the Lord,<br/>When the family gets together in the Lord,<br/>We will love one another like sister and brother<br/>When the family gets together in the Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>When the tall and the small get together in the Lord<br/>Get together in the Lord<br/>We will soon realize that we're all the same size<br/>When we all get together in the Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>When we all submit together, flow together in the Lord<br/>And submit together in the Lord<br/>In the life of God we'll flow<br/>And each member shall surely know<br/>We're the many-membered Body of the Lord.</lines>
