    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There is strength within the sorrow, There is beauty in our tears<br/>You meet us in our mourning, With a love that casts out fear<br/>You are working in our waiting, Sanctifying us<br/>When beyond our understanding, You're teaching us to trust</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Your plans are still to prosper, You have not forgotten us<br/>You're with us in the fire and the flood<br/>Faithful forever, Perfect in love<br/>You are sovereign over us</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>You are wisdom unimagined, Who could understand your ways<br/>Reigning high above the heavens, Reaching down in endless grace<br/>You're the Lifter of the lowly, Compassionate and kind<br/>You surround and You uphold me, Your promises are my delight</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Even what the enemy means for evil<br/>You turn it for our good, You turn it for our good and for your glory<br/>Even in the valley You are faithful<br/>You're working for our good, You're working for our good and for your glory</lines>
    </verse>
