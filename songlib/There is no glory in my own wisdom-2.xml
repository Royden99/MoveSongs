      <lines>There is no glory in my own wisdom, <br/>There is no power in my own strength, <br/>There is no might in my own riches, <br/>But I will boast in knowing you.<br/>Chorus:<br/>For You are high and lifted up, glory of the nations! <br/>You are high and lifted up, Lord of all the earth! <br/>You are high and lifted up, Creator, Redeemer;<br/>I will boast in knowing You.</lines>
