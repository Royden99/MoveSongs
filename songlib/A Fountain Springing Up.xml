    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>A fountain springing up<br/>A river flowing out and whosoever will may come.<br/>the waters that I bring you are springing up within you and you will never thirst again.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>A fountain springs up in the valley,<br/>Waters deep and crystal clear,<br/>My love for you is like that fountain,<br/>all my springs are in you.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The fountain flows into the river,<br/>living waters running deep<br/>The current's moving is so strong,<br/>that it will flow eternally.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>And as we drink these living waters<br/>our roots together go down deep,<br/>and we'll bear fruit in every season<br/>Cause we are planted like a tree.</lines>
    </verse>
