    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The Lord told Jonah to go down<br/>To Nineveh that old wicked town.<br/>But Jonah didn't want to go where he was sent<br/>Until that big fish came along<br/>And showed old Jonah he was wrong<br/>And after that ordeal he changed his mind and went<br/>Chorus:<br/>When God tells you what to do, you better do it.<br/>You better do it! You better do it!<br/>It doesn't pay to disobey; that's all there's to it.<br/>Like old Jonah, you'll find out the hard, hard way!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Old Jonah thought he'd fooled the Lord.<br/>He found a ship and got on board.<br/>Away they went a sailing out upon the sea.<br/>After a while the sea waves roared.<br/>The men threw Jonah overboard<br/>And then he knew he wasn't where he ought to be.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Well for three days and nights he stayed<br/>inside that fish, and how he prayed, until<br/>the Lord told that old fish to spit him out.<br/>He brought him up on the dry ground,<br/>and Jonah, tired of foolin' round packed up<br/>and went to Ninevah without a doubt!</lines>
