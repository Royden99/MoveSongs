      <lines>I will bless the Lord at all times.<br/> His praise shall continually be in my mouth<br/>My soul shall make her boast in Thee, Lord. <br/>The humble shall hear thereof and be glad.<br/> O magnify the Lord with me<br/> And let us exalt His name together.<br/> I sought the Lord and He heard me <br/>And delivered me from alI of my fears.</lines>
