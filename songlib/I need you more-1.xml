    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I need You more,<br/>More than yesterday.<br/>I need You more,<br/>More than words can say.<br/>I need You more,<br/>Than ever before.<br/>I need you more.<br/>I need you, Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>More than the air I breathe,<br/>More than the song I sing,<br/>More than the next heartbeat,<br/>More than anything.<br/>And Lord as time goes by<br/>I will be by Your side,<br/>'Cause I never want to go back<br/>To my old life.</lines>
