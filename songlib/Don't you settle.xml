    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Listen brother to the trumpet sound.<br/>We are free and no longer bound. <br/>When the Son has set you free <br/>Rise up and proclaim your liberty.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Don't you settle for the prison floor <br/>When the Lord has offered you so much more.<br/>Shed your shackles of sin and doubt.<br/>Let faith arise! Walk on out!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Beware the enemy seeks to bind<br/> And take captivity of your mind, <br/> Telling you that you can't be free<br/> And there's no such thing as Jubilee</lines>
    </verse>
