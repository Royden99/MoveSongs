    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There's a people of God coming forth in the earth<br/>Being brought out of judgement that they might give birth<br/>To the mighty love of God that chooses to see<br/>The nature of Christ dwelling in you and me.<br/>We have chosen to walk in meekness and love<br/>Leaving behind the rod<br/>We have chosen to walk in meekness and love<br/>Living more and more in God.<br/>There's a people of God being brought forth to give birth<br/>To the order of Melchizedec - they'll rule and reign on earth<br/>Caught up to the throne and having God's name</lines>
