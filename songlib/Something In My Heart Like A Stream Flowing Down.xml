    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Something in my heart like a stream flowing down<br/>Makes me feel so happy, as happy as can be<br/>When I think of Jesus and what He's done for me<br/>There's something in my heart like a stream coming down.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Coming down, down, down,<br/>Coming down, down, down,<br/>The glory of the Lord is coming down<br/>Where the saints of God are found<br/>There is glory all around.<br/>The glory of the Lord is coming down.</lines>
