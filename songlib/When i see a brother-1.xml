    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When I see a brother standing like a mountain,<br/>When I see a sister glowing like a fire,<br/>Something inside me like a bubbling fountain<br/>Quickens my faith,<br/>Makes me want to take just another step higher.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Then I know if He did it for them<br/>God will do it for me;<br/>He'll break the bonds,<br/>Right the wrongs and set me free;<br/>Oh, if  he did it for them God will do it for me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>When I see a brother going through a battle,<br/>Raising his hands in a victory song,<br/>A sister who knows what it is to be shackled<br/>Stand and proclaim<br/>That, in Jesus' name, she's free once again,</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Then I know.....<br/></lines>
