    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I have walked alone in life for far too long<br/>so i will reach out my hand to Father God alone<br/>I have come through many miles of darkened road,<br/>And I will gladly let the Lord shoulder the load.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>'Cause Jesus is the answer to all life's questions,<br/>and He will never leave me alone<br/>I'm reaching out to Jesus as my Saviour,<br/>And i will serve the Lord</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>God is grace and God is love he guides my every step<br/>he leads me down a holy road into righteousness<br/>He burns away the sinful man in His holy flame<br/>He cleanses me with his power in His mighty name</lines>
