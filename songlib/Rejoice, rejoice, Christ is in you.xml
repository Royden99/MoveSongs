    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Now is the time for us to march upon the land<br/>Into our hands, He will give the ground we claim<br/>He rides in majesty to lead us into victory<br/>The world shall see that Christ is Lord</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>God is at work in us, His purpose to perform<br/>Building a kingdom of power not of words<br/>Where things impossible<br/>By faith shall be made possible<br/>Let’s give the glory to Him now</lines>

      <lines>Though we are weak His grace is everything we need<br/>We’re made of clay but this treasure is within<br/>He turns our weaknesses into His opportunities<br/>So that the glory goes to Him<br/></lines>
