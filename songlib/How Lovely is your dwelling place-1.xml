    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>How lovely is Thy dwelling place, O Lord of hosts,<br/>My soul longs and yearns for Thy courts<br/>And my heart and flesh sing for joy to the living God.<br/>One day in Thy presence is far better to me than gold<br/>Or to live my whole life somewhere else,<br/>And I would rather be a door-keeper in Your house<br/>Than to take my fate upon myself.<br/>You are my sun and my shield,<br/>You are my lover from the start,<br/>And the highway to Your city runs through my heart.<br/></lines>
