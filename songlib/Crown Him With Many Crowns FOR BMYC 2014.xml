    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Crown Him with many crowns, The Lamb upon His throne.<br/>Hark! how the heavenly anthem drowns All music but its own!<br/>Awake, my soul and sing Of Him who died for Thee;<br/>And hail Him as thy matchless King Through all eternity.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Crown Him the Lord of life, Who triumphed o'er the grave.<br/>Who rose victorious to the strife, For those He came to save.<br/>His glories now we sing, Who died and rose on high.<br/>Who died eternal life to bring, And lives that death may die.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Crown Him the Lord of heaven: One with the Father known,<br/>One with the Spirit Through Him given<br/>From yonder glorious throne.  All hail, Redeemer, hail!<br/>For Thou hast died for me; Thy praise and glory shall not fail <br/>Throughout eternity.</lines>
    </verse>
