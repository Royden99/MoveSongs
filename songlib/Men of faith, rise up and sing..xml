    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Men of faith, rise up and sing.<br/>Of the great and glorious King.<br/>You are strong when you feel weak.<br/>In your brokenness complete.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Shout to the North and the South,<br/>Sing to the East and the West:<br/>Jesus is Saviour to all,<br/>Lord of heaven and earth.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Rise up, women of the truth,<br/>Stand and sing to broken hearts,<br/>Who can know the healing power<br/>Of our glorious King of love?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>We've been through fire,<br/>We've been through rain;<br/>We've been refined<br/>By the power of His name.<br/>We've fallen deeper in love with You,<br/>You've burned the truth on our lips.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Rise up, Church with broken wings;<br/>Fill this place with songs again<br/>Of our God Who reigns on high:<br/>By His grace again we'll fly.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Shout to the North and the South,<br/>Sing to the East and the West:<br/>Jesus is Saviour to all,<br/>Lord of heaven and earth,<br/>Lord of heaven and earth,<br/>Lord of heaven and earth,<br/>Lord of heaven and earth.<br/></lines>
