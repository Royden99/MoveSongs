    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O sing unto the Lord a new song,<br/>For He has done marvellous things:<br/>His right hand and His holy arm<br/>Have gotten Him the victory.<br/>The Lord has made known his salvation<br/>His righteousness has he openly showed<br/>In the sight of the heathen;<br/>O sing unto the Lord a new song.<br/>He has remembered His mercy and His truth<br/>Toward the house of Israel,<br/>All the ends of the earth have seen<br/>The salvation of our God.<br/></lines>
