    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Oh I thank you Lord for your faithfulness.<br/>And I thank you Lord for your truth.<br/>There've been times I just did not understand.<br/>But I thank you Lord for your Word.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>It's the Word that sets us free.<br/>It is the Word that brings light, with darkness all around.<br/>It's the spoken Word, that comes from up above.<br/>And I thank you Lord for your Word.</lines>
