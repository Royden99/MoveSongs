    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Lord, I stand in the midst of a multitude<br/>Those from every tribe and tongue,<br/>We are Your people, redeemed by Your blood,<br/>Purchased from death by Your love.<br/>There are no words good enough to thank You,<br/>There are no words to express my praise;<br/>But I will lift up my voice<br/>And sing from my heart<br/>With all of my strength.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Hallelujah, Hallelujah,<br/>Hallelujah to the Lamb;<br/>Hallelujah, Hallelujah,<br/>By the blood of Christ we stand<br/>Every tongue, every tribe,<br/>Every people, every land,<br/>Giving glory, giving honour, giving praise<br/>Unto the Lamb of God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Lord, we stand by grace in Your presence<br/>Cleansed by the blood of the Lamb;<br/>We are Your children, called by Your Name,<br/>Humbly we bow and we pray.<br/>Release Your power to work in us and through us<br/>Till we are changed to be more like You;<br/>Then all the nations will see Your glory revealed<br/>And worship You.<br/></lines>
