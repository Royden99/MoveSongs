    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There's a sweet, sweet Spirit in this place<br/>And I know that it's the Spirit of the Lord<br/>There's a sweet expression on each face<br/>And I know that it's the Spirit of the Lord<br/>Sweet Holy Spirit, sweet heavenly dove<br/>Stay right here with us, filling us with Your love<br/>And for each blessing, we lift our hearts in praise<br/>Without a doubt we'll know that we have been revived<br/>When we shall leave this place.</lines>
