    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>According to the hand,<br/>Of the good Lord upon me,<br/>We'll take the land.<br/>An exceeding good land<br/>If the Lord delight in us<br/>Then He will bring us to this land<br/>And give it to us<br/>Only rebel not against the Lord<br/>Neither fear ye the people of the land<br/>They are bread for us<br/>Their defence is departed from them<br/>And the Lord is with us.<br/>Fear them not.</lines>
