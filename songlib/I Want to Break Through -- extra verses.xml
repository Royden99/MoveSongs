    <verse name="v1a">
      <lines>I'm going to break through.<br/>I'm going to break through.<br/>I'll know as I'm known; I'll know you alone.<br/>I'm going to break through.<br/>Now there's no sin that can stand in the way.<br/>I will enter in; you've opened the way.<br/>I'll see your glory, I'll see your face.<br/>I'm going to break through.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>When I was a child, I thought as a child,<br/>And childish things I longed for.<br/>But when I grew up, childish things I laid aside.<br/>And now, you're calling me to something deeper.<br/>Though now dimly I see, you're coming in me,<br/>And I shall break through.</lines>
