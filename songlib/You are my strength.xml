      <lines>You are  my strength when I am weak<br/>You are the treasure that I seek, <br/>You are my all in all.<br/>Seeking You as a precious jewel,<br/> Lord to give up I'd be a fool.<br/>You are my all in all.</lines>

    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>You've taken my sin, my cross, my shame.<br/>Rising again I'll bless Your name,<br/>           You are my all in all.<br/>When I fall down You pick me up,<br/>When I am dry You fill my cup.<br/>You are my all in all.</lines>
