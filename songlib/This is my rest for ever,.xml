    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>This is my rest for ever,<br/>Here will I dwell<br/>For the Lord has chosen Zion<br/>He has desired it for His habitation.<br/>I will abundantly bless her provision<br/>And satisfy her poor with bread,<br/>I will clothe her priests with salvation<br/>And her saints shall shout aloud for joy.<br/></lines>
