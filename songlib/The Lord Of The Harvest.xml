    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I will sing to the Lord of the harvest,<br/>I will sing to the Lord of this day,<br/>I will bring to Him thanksgiving and praise,<br/>For we only give Him our best.<br/>We only give him our best.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>All our hopes and dreams are found in Him,<br/>All our cares are lost in His presence,<br/>As we weep for joy all people are blessed,<br/>For our hearts are singing within.<br/>Our hearts are singing within.</lines>
