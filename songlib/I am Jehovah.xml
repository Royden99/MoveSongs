    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I am Jehovah, I am that I am,<br/>          And my trumpet shall soon call out. <br/>          I formed the world with a whisper.<br/>          But I'm getting ready, I'm getting ready,<br/>          I'm getting ready to shout!<br/> It's the Name above all names.<br/> We will declare it, yes we will declare it.<br/> It's the Name above all names.<br/> And we will shout it to a dying world.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Who will declare My name?<br/> Who will shout My name, <br/> In the middle of the nations?<br/> Who will take the shield of faith,<br/> And the sword of My word? <br/> And declare My name to a dying world?<br/> He who has declared me thus far, <br/> Shall walk in even greater power.<br/> For the sands of time are running out. <br/> But My name shall be declared in this final hour.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I will possess my people. I'll take every inch <br/>That they will surrender to Me.<br/>For I'm gathering an army <br/>And I'm giving them My name.<br/>My word in their mouth<br/>Shall set the captives free.</lines>
