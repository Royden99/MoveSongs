    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>Well you can't hurry God; you just have to wait.<br/>You gotta trust God, give Him time, no matter how long it takes.<br/>He's a God that you can't hurry. He'll be there, don't you worry.<br/>He may not come when you want Him but He's right on time.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Well, Job was sick so long, till the flesh fell from his bones.<br/>His wife, cattle, and children; everything he had was gone.<br/>He said you put this affliction upon me.<br/>Why don't you come and see about me.<br/>He may not come when you want Him but He's right on time.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Some say He's coming in the morning; gonna make His journey by train.<br/>Some say He's coming a chariot, shaped like an eagle's wings.<br/>But we know how He's coming. Don't let Him catch you with your work undone.<br/>He may not come when you want Him but He's right on time.</lines>
