    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We need to have a high perspective<br/>Of the life we life,<br/>Getting our heads up out of the sand;<br/>Living each day as the Father above<br/>Has planned for us,<br/>And rising above on eagle's wings.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>We need to rise on eagle's wings;<br/>Soaring over the earth in the heavenlies.<br/>We need to rise on eagle's wings,<br/>Getting the Father's perspective on life and things.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Living each day in the palm of the Father's hand,<br/>Letting the Holy Spirit guide us in His ways.<br/>Looking at each situation with God's divine insight,<br/>And rising above on eagle's wings.</lines>
