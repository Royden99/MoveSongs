    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Can you hear the sound of heaven?<br/>Like the sound of many waters,<br/>It's the sound of worship coming from the throne.<br/>There are cries of adoration<br/>As men from every nation<br/>Lift their voice to make His glory known, singing:<br/>Chorus:<br/>Holy, holy, holy are You, Lord.<br/>Holy, holy, holy are You, Lord.<br/>The elders and angels bow.<br/>The redeemed worship You now.<br/>Holy, holy, holy are You, Lord.</lines>
