    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Thou Who wast rich beyond all splendour,<br/>All for love's sake becamest poor;<br/>Thrones for a manger didst surrender<br/>Sapphire-paved courts for stable floor.<br/>Thou Who wast rich beyond all splendour,<br/>All for love's sake becamest poor.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Thou Who art God beyond all praising,<br/>All for love's sake becamest Man;<br/>Stooping so low, but sinners raising<br/>Heav'nwards by Thine eternal plan.<br/>Thou Who art God beyond all praising,<br/>All for love's sake becamest Man.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Thou Who art love beyond all telling,<br/>Saviour and King, we worship Thee.<br/>Emmanuel, within us dwelling,<br/>Make us what Thou wouldst have us be.<br/>Thou Who art love beyond all telling,<br/>Saviour and King, we worship Thee.<br/></lines>
