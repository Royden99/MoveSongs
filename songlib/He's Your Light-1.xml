    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Oh the darkness covers all the earth <br/>and gross darkness all the people. <br/>But the Lord will arise upon thee, <br/>And His glory shall be seen upon thee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Chorus #1: <br/>He’s your light. He’s your light. <br/>He will guide you through the darkest night. <br/>He’s your light. He’s your light. <br/>He will guide you through the darkest night. <br/>He’s your light and He shines through you and me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Well a thousand shall fall at your side <br/>and ten-thousand at your right hand. <br/>But I’m not afraid of the terror by night <br/>or the arrow that flies by the day. </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Chorus #2:<br/>He’s alive. He’s alive. <br/>He has conquered death - we shall do the same. <br/>He’s alive. He’s alive. <br/>He has conquered death - we shall do the same. <br/>He’s alive. And He lives in you and me.</lines>
