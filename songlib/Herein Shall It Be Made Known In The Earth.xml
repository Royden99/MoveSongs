    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Herein shall it be made known in the earth,<br/>That we have found grace in Thy sight.<br/>If Thy presence go with us, within us to change us,<br/>To be Thy inheritance.<br/>Show us Thy way that we may know Thee.<br/>Separate us to Thy rest.<br/>Show us Thy glory, O Lord our God.<br/>Descend in the cloud and proclaim Thy Name.<br/>Merciful, gracious, suffering Lord,<br/>Full of goodness and truth.<br/>Show us Thy glory, O Lord our God.<br/>We would yield all and worship Thee.</lines>
