    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Yes, Lord, yes!<br/>To Your will and to Your way<br/>I say, Yes, Lord, yes<br/>I will trust You and obey.<br/>When Your Spirit speaks to me<br/>With my whole heart I agree,<br/>And my answer, it is, Yes, Lord, yes.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Lord, I give You all the glory<br/>For all You've given me.<br/>You have filled my life until I overflow.<br/>All I am is Yours to use in any way You choose.<br/>You are Lord of all so how can I say no?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>If I never knew the fullness of living in Your will,<br/>I would never know how rich my life could be.<br/>So my willingness to serve<br/>Is the least that You deserve<br/>For the blessings You have showered over me.</lines>
