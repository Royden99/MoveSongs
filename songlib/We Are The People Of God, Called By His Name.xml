    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We're the people of God,<br/>Called by His name,<br/>Called from the dark,<br/>And delivered from shame;<br/>One holy race, saints every one,<br/>Because of the blood of Christ Jesus the Son.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>With our lips let us sing one confession,<br/>With our hearts hold to one truth alone.<br/>For He has erased our transgressions,<br/>Claimed us, and called us His own, His very own.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Hear us, O spirits of darkness,<br/>So you will know where we stand.<br/>We are His servants, purchased with scars,<br/>Bought by the blood of the Lamb,<br/>The blood of the Lamb.<br/></lines>
