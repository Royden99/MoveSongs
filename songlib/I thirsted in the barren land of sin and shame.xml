    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I thirsted in the barren land of sin and shame<br/>And nothing satisfying there I found.<br/>But to the blessed cross of Christ one day I came<br/>Where springs of living water did abound.<br/>Chorus:<br/>Drinking at the springs of living water,<br/>Happy now am I. My soul is satisfied<br/>Drinking at the springs of living water,<br/>O wonderful and bountiful supply.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>How sweet the living water from the hills of God,<br/>It makes me glad and happy all the way.<br/>Now glory, grace, and blessing mark the path I've trod.<br/>I'm shouting, Hallelujah! every day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>O sinner, won't you come today to Calvary?<br/>A fountain there is flowing deep and wide.<br/>The Savior now invites you to the water free<br/>Where thirsting spirits can be satisfied.</lines>
