    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There burns a fire with sacred heat<br/>White hot with holy flame<br/>And all who dare pass through its blaze<br/>Will not emerge the same<br/>Some as bronze, and some as silver<br/>Some as gold, then with great skill<br/>All are hammered by their sufferings<br/>On the anvil of His will</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>The Refiner’s fire<br/>Has now become my souls desire<br/>Purged and cleansed and purified<br/>That the Lord be glorified<br/>He is consuming my soul<br/>Refining me, making me whole<br/>No matter what I may lose<br/>I choose the Refiner’s fire</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I’m learning now to trust His touch<br/>To crave the fire’s embrace<br/>For though my past with sin was etched<br/>His mercies did erase<br/>Each time His purging cleanses deeper<br/>I’m not sure that I’ll survive<br/>Yet the strength in growing weaker<br/>Keeps my hungry soul alive</lines>
