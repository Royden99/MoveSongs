    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Praise ye the Lord, praise ye the Lord,<br/>Praise ye the Lord, praise ye the Lord.<br/>Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord.<br/>Praise Him in the firmament of His power.<br/>Praise Him with the sound of the trumpet,<br/>Praise Him with the psaltry and harp,<br/>Praise Him with the timbrel and dance,<br/>With stringed instruments and organs,<br/>And upon the high-sounding cymbals,<br/>Let everything, let everything,<br/>Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord.<br/></lines>
