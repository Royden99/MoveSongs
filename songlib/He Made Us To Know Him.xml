    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He made us to know Him,<br/>To love and to serve Him.<br/>We do not deserve Him,<br/>And all of His grace.<br/>He made us to praise Him,<br/>To need Him, to seek Him,<br/>And then to express<br/>Him in wonderful ways.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He made us quite empty,<br/>But empty for filling,<br/>For filling with goodness,<br/>For filling with praise.<br/>But first He must show us<br/>The sin that still lingers,<br/>That lingers and clutters<br/>Our heart's inner space.</lines>
