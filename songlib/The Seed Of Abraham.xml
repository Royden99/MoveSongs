    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The seed of Abraham, that's who I am.<br/>Risen from the dead unto his life.<br/>No longer a slave. Brought up from the grave.<br/>A stranger and a pilgrim in this world that I live in.<br/>The seed of Abraham, that's who I am.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The Lord called Abraham out of Ur of the Chaldees.<br/>Said go up to a land that I will show.<br/>I'll multiply your seed, and meet your every need.<br/>I'll make you the father of the faithful and the pure.<br/>And blessing, I will bless you, Abraham</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Now separate thyself, my son, Abraham.<br/>Consider not the deadness of the womb.<br/>For Sarah shall bring forth a son to bear thy name.<br/>All the families of the earth shall be blessed because of thee.<br/>Stagger not at the promise, Abraham.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Now take thine only son up Moriah, Abraham.<br/>And give him back to me upon the fire.<br/>And though his body's dead, I'll raise him up again.<br/>The resurrection that I bring will show him as the Son of God.<br/>And conquer death forever, Abraham.</lines>
