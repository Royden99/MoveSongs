    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There's a joy deep down,<br/>That's in my heart today,<br/>There's a joy deep down,<br/>That's in my heart to stay,<br/>For the Lord has redeemed Israel<br/>And set her free again,<br/>Oh there's a joy deep down<br/>That's in my heart to stay.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>All the trees clap their hands,<br/>And the mountains sing their praise,<br/>Let the fields rejoice,<br/>And streams break forth in praise,<br/>For the Lord has redeemed Israel,<br/>And set her free again,<br/>Oh there's a joy deep down,<br/>That's in my heart to stay.<br/></lines>
