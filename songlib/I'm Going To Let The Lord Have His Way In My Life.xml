    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I'm going to let the Lord have His way in my life.<br/>What have I got to lose and why should I strive?<br/>He only wants to make me the highest any man could ever be.<br/>Why should I be bound up when He only wants to set me free?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>His ways are higher than mine<br/>And a whole lot better<br/>Than I could ever make them myself.<br/>He's got everything I'm ever going to need my whole immortal life.<br/>He fashioned me out of the dust of the earth<br/>With His own two loving hands.<br/>Why should I be upset when He wants to fit me into His plans?</lines>
