    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Where do I go, when there's nobody there to turn to?<br/>Who do I talk, to when there's nobody there to listen?<br/>Who do I lean on, when there's no foundation stable?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I go to the Rock,<br/>I know He's able,<br/>I go to the Rock.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I go to the Rock of my salvation,<br/>I go to the stone that the builders rejected,<br/>I run to the mountain and the mountain stands by me;<br/>When the earth all around me is sinking sand<br/>On Christ, the solid rock I stand,<br/>When I need a shelter, when I need a friend,<br/>I go to the Rock.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Where do I go, where do I go,<br/>When the storms of life are threatening?<br/>Who do I turn to, when those winds of sorrow blow?<br/>And is there a refuge in the time of tribulation?<br/></lines>
