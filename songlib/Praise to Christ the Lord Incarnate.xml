    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Praise to Christ, the Man of sorrows,<br/>tasting death for our release:<br/>his the cup of bitter anguish,<br/>ours the pardon, ours the peace;<br/>his the blood that seals forgiveness,<br/>ours the weight of guilt he bore â€“<br/>so by death and resurrection<br/>Christ has opened heaven's door.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Praise to Christ, the Priest eternal:<br/>still for us he intercedes;<br/>still he sees our pains and problems<br/>how he understands our needs!<br/>Yesterday, today, forever,<br/>always he remains the same:<br/>pledged to bring us to the Father,<br/>strong in grace and free from blame<br/></lines>
