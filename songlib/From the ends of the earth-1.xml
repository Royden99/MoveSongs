      <lines>From the ends of the earth, (From the ends of the earth,)<br/>From the depth of the sea, (From the depth of the sea,)<br/>From the height of the heaven, (From the height of the heaven,)<br/>Your name be praised.<br/>From the hearts of the weak, (From the hearts of the weak,)<br/>From the shouts of the strong, (From the shouts of the strong,)<br/>From the lips of all people, (From the lips of all people,)<br/>Your song be raised.<br/>Chorus:<br/>Throughout the endless ages,<br/>You will be crowed with praises,<br/>Lord most high.<br/>Exalted in every nation,<br/>Sovereign of all creation,<br/>Lord most high.<br/>Be magnified.</lines>
