    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Down at the cross, where my Savior died,<br/>Down where the cleansing from sin I cried,<br/>There to my heart was the blood applied.<br/>Glory to His name.<br/>Chorus:<br/>Glory to His name. Glory to His name.<br/>There to my heart was the blood applied.<br/>Glory to His name.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I am so wondrously saved from sin.<br/>Jesus so sweetly abides within.<br/>There at the cross where He took me in.<br/>Glory to His name.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>O, precious fountain that saves from sin,<br/>I am so glad I have entered in.<br/>There Jesus saves me and keeps me clean.<br/>Glory to His name.</lines>
