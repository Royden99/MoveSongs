      <lines>Rest in Me, children of Mine<br/>And I'll give you peace within,<br/>Rest in Me, and do not strive<br/>If the battle you would win;<br/>Rest in Me, take My yoke,<br/>For the power of sin I broke<br/>At Calvary, to set you free,<br/>So rest in Me.</lines>

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Rest in Me, children of Mine,<br/>You are on the victory side,<br/>Rest in Me, for I will soon<br/>Come again and take My bride;<br/>Rest in Me, persevere<br/>For your redemption draweth near,<br/>Until that day, just watch and pray<br/>And rest in Me.<br/></lines>
