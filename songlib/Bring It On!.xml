    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>To all the wearied hearts we bring you an answer,<br/>Yes, a nation can be born in a day.<br/>Know, little flock, that it's our Master's good pleasure,<br/>That by all means we can create a new day.<br/>Chorus:<br/>BRING IT ON! Raise a war cry that the world's gotta hear.<br/>BRING IT ON! Rise up the trumpet's sounding is clear<br/>BRING IT ON! Well done, He will cry in that hour<br/>BRING IT ON! As we rise up, see the kingdom of power.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>To all the fearful hearts we bring you an answer,<br/>Our King is with us and He will not delay.<br/>To bring about a mighty Kingdom of treasure,<br/>To conquer all things that may stand in our way.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>To all the faithful hearts we bring you an answer,<br/>Now is the time to march in battle array.<br/>The land is ours, it is a gift without measure,<br/>Now is the time to come together and say:</lines>
