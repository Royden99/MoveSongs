    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Lord, I come to You let my heart be changed, renewed <br/>      Flowing from the grace that I've found in You.<br/>Lord, I've come to know the weaknesses I see in me<br/>Will be stripped away by the power of Your love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Hold me close; let Your love surround me.<br/>Bring me near; draw me to Your side.<br/>And as I wait I'll rise up as the eagle.<br/>I will soar with You; Your Spirit leads me on<br/>In the power of Your love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Lord, unveil my eyes; let me see You face to face.<br/>The knowledge of Your love as You live in me.<br/>Lord, renew my mind, as Your will unfolds in my life<br/>In living every day by the power of Your love.</lines>
    </verse>
