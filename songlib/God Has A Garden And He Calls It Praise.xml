    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>God has a garden and He calls it praise.<br/>He bids us to enter and walk through the maze.<br/>Well, it's like an ocean so vast and so free,<br/>And God said He made it for you and for me.<br/>Chorus:<br/>So I exalt Him with all of my being.<br/>I will extol Him with all that I am.<br/>And if I should falter, all nature will praise Him.<br/>And I will now glory His precious name.<br/>And I will now glory His precious name.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And in that garden there's freedom from sin.<br/>There's no condemnation to those who walk in.<br/>Because of the Keeper, there's love all around.<br/>There's healing and blessing on this holy ground.</lines>
