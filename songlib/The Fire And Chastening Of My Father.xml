      <lines>The fire and the chastening of my Father<br/>Only come so I might have the life<br/>That He desires to bring forth in me,<br/>So I can be free, so you can be free.<br/>Chorus:<br/>I shall be free to praise His holy name<br/>I shall be free to walk in His pure love,<br/>I shall be free to do His perfect will.<br/>I shall be free so you can be free</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I'll lay down my life, I'll give my all for you<br/>So that the life of my God might shine forth,<br/>That perfect life that will set creation free;<br/>And I shall be free so you can be free.<br/>Chorus:<br/>We shall be free to praise His holy name.<br/>We shall be free to walk in His pure love.<br/>We shall be free to do His perfect will.<br/>We shall be free; yes, we shall be free.</lines>
