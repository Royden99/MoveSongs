      <lines>The move is on my Lord, the move is on.<br/>The move is on my Lord, the move is on.<br/>I hear the rustling in the mulberry trees<br/>And I know, I know, I know the move is on.<br/>Move on brother, move on sister<br/>This is a moving day<br/>Move a little closer where the streams are flowing<br/>Move on brother, move on.</lines>
