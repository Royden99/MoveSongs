    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I hear angels singing praises,<br/>I see men from every nation<br/>Bowing down before the throne<br/>Like the sound of many waters,<br/>Like the rushing wind around us;<br/>Multitudes join the song<br/>And a symphony of praise arises,<br/>Tears are wiped away from eyes<br/>As men from every tongue<br/>And tribe now sing:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Holy, holy, God Almighty,<br/>Who was, Who is and is to come,<br/>All the angels are crying holy<br/>To the Lamb Who sits upon the throne;<br/>Holy, holy, God Almighty,<br/>Who was, Who is and is to come,<br/>All creation is bringing glory<br/>To the Lamb Who sits upon the throne.<br/></lines>
