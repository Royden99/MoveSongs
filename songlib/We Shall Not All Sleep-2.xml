    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We shall not all sleep, but we'll all be changed in a moment,<br/>In a twinkling of an eye the last trumpet shall sound<br/>And the dead shall be raised, incorruptible<br/>And death and the grave are swallowed in victory,<br/>And God, yes our God, shall fill all in all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>We are not without hope, not without hope, not without joy,<br/>Not without power, not without praise, not without faith<br/>Not without strength to finish this race.<br/>Not without help, our help is the Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Though there be battles and though there be loss<br/>We're not afraid, we've counted the cost.<br/>With the armour of God to the right and the left<br/>Our Captain is Christ, our enemy, death.<br/>And the saints of all time are cheering us on.</lines>
