    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Bring forth the dawn,<br/>For the time has now come<br/>That all mourning and weeping be cast away.<br/>Create anew as You speak forth the word,<br/>For we’re pressing into a new day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Shout at the walls that stand in your way<br/>And rejoice as you see them fall.<br/>Lift up your eyes and behold a new day<br/>Where we live by a trumpet call.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>O sons, rejoice for the word has now come<br/>That will bind and will loose and will set you free.<br/>Leave all behind, for the word has now come<br/>That will create a purity.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Bring down the faith that contains a new age<br/>And displaces the vision of yesterday,<br/>New expectations are filling our hearts<br/>For we’re pressing into a new day.<br/></lines>
