      <lines>Well, I don't want silver and I don't want gold.<br/>The things of this world soon grow old.<br/>Give me Jesus and I'll be satisfied.<br/>Well I don't want houses and I don't want lands.<br/>I'd rather feel the touch of His nail scarred hands.<br/>Give me Jesus and I'll be satisfied.<br/>Chorus:<br/>Give me Jesus, what a wonderful Lord!<br/>Give me Jesus and take the things of this old world.<br/>Give me Jesus and let me in His love abide.<br/>Give me Jesus and I'm satisfied.</lines>
