    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Father of creation, unfold Your sovereign plan.<br/>Raise up a chosen generation<br/>That will march through the land.<br/>All of creation is longing<br/>For Your unveiling of power,<br/>Would You release Your anointing?<br/>O God, let this be the hour!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Let Your glory fall in this room,<br/>Let it go forth from here to the nations;<br/>Let Your fragrance rest in this place<br/>As we gather to seek Your face.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Ruler of the nations, the world has yet to see<br/>The full release of Your promise:<br/>The church in victory.<br/>Turn to us, Lord, and touch us,<br/>Make us strong in Your might;<br/>Overcome our weakness<br/>That we could stand up and fight!<br/></lines>
