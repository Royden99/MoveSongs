    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>On a hill far away<br/>Stood an old rugged cross<br/>The emblem of suffering and shame<br/>And I love that old cross<br/>Where the dearest and best<br/>For a world of lost sinners was slain.<br/>Chorus:<br/>So I'll cherish the old rugged cross<br/>Till my trophies at last I lay down<br/>I will cling to the old rugged cross<br/>And exchange it someday for a crown.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>O, the old rugged cross, so despised by the world<br/>Has a wondrous attraction for me<br/>For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above<br/>To bear it to dark Calvary.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>To the old rugged cross I will ever be true<br/>Its shame and reproach gladly bear<br/>Then He'll call me someday to my home in this way<br/>Where His glory forever I'll share.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>O thou old rugged cross come and live in my heart<br/>And lead me to death every day.<br/>That the life of my Lord may flow out of my heart<br/>To His body and all men I pray.</lines>
    </verse>
