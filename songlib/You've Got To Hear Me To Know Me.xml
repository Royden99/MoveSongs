    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>My people won't you listen, I have given you<br/>Ears to hear the truth, for the time of truth is here.<br/>Have patience and don't weaken; all creation is yours<br/>This way to Zion, you listen and you hear.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>You've got to hear me to know me. Know me to love me<br/>Love me to live it out my way.<br/>You've got to live it to walk it. Walk it to give it.<br/>Give it to have it on that day.</lines>
