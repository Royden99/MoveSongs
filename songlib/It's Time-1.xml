    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>It's time for the babes to be children,<br/>Time for the children to be sons,<br/>Time for the sons to be fathers,<br/>Time for God's people to be one;</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>It's time for the fearful to take courage,<br/>Time for the weak to be strong,<br/>It's time for God's people to gather,<br/>And it's time for the ark to move on.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Oh, brethren, these are perilous times,<br/>As the Lord by His servants has warned,<br/>But what be our answer if we turn aside,<br/>Nay, but we shall arise and press on.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>It's time for the manchild to be born,<br/>It's time for the trumpet to sound,<br/>Death still must be beaten,<br/>The time, fellow soldiers, is now.<br/></lines>
