    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Take me past the outer courts,<br/>And through the Holy Place,<br/>Past the brazen altar,<br/>Lord, I want to see Your face.<br/>Pass me by the crowds of people,<br/>And the priests who sing Your praise.<br/>I hunger and thirst for Your righteousness,<br/>But it's only found one place.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Take me in to the Holy of Holies.<br/>Take me in by the blood of the Lamb.<br/>Take me in to the Holy of Holies;<br/>Take the coal, touch my lips,<br/>Hear I am.</lines>
