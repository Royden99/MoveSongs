    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We walk by faith and not by sight,<br/>We walk together hand in hand;<br/>To give strength to each other,<br/>When the flesh would say, "turn back",<br/>We walk this narrow road to the cross.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>All that I have lies in my brother,<br/>So when the going gets rough we have each other,<br/>And as we look to the cross, we know it's death,<br/>But there's a greater life beyond,<br/>When we walk by faith and not by sight.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>As we walk down this narrow road,<br/>We lose many ones we love,<br/>But as all heaven and earth look down on us,<br/>All creation is rejoicing,<br/>Just waiting to be set free;<br/>For God has a people determined to go all the way,<br/>For they walk by faith and not by sight.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>As the sons of God go marching down this road,<br/>Each bearing the burden of the other,<br/>They sing the songs of Zion,<br/>With victory in their hearts,<br/>For they're walking as one man,<br/>For they walk by faith and not by sight.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Beloved, let us walk this way,<br/>Let us give glory in all things;<br/>For He shall surely lead us,<br/>Man's wisdom is God's foolishness,<br/>For there is glory in the cross,<br/>And the cross in our life,<br/>For we walk by faith and not by sight.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
