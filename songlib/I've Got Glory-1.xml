    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Oh it's good to know that we<br/>Are finally set free,<br/>By the birth of the Father in His sons,<br/>And now we are enjoying<br/>The blessings of His wellsprings<br/>As we move in the oneness of His son.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I've got glory coming at me from both sides,<br/>I've got glory flowing over me in tides,<br/>I've got glory shining at me like sunshine, it seems,<br/>And it's You, my Father, beloved Guide.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>We speak His word throughout the land<br/>As we sit at His right hand,<br/>Our names are written in the book with His blood;<br/>As we move in unity<br/>We shall set the captives<br/>And we long to hear the words:<br/>"Well done, My son!"<br/></lines>
