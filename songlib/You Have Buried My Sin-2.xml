    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>You have buried my sins in the depths of the sea.<br/>You've carried my guilt far away.<br/>As far as the east is from the west,<br/>You've removed my transgressions from me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>So I'll tell of Your mercies; I'll sing of Your grace;<br/>I'll walk in Your liberty.<br/>And I'll live in the awesome light of Your love,<br/>'Cause I know that I am free.</lines>
