    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>People of God, it is time to arise<br/>And proclaim to creation, “We're not going to die.”<br/>Let it ring from the valleys and mountains so high,<br/>God's people proclaiming, “We're not going to die!”<br/>All heaven's rejoicing, now hear them all sing,<br/>“Grave, where's thy victory and death, where's thy sting?”<br/>The saints of the centuries have all come to pass<br/>With each one fulfi lling their God-given task.<br/>But to the Sons God has spoken, and we witness His cry.<br/>“Proclaim to Creation, you're not going to die!”<br/>Now the prophets of old had a line that they laid<br/>And though they were steadfast, these all died in faith.<br/>But they spoke of a people who would one day arise<br/>And proclaim to creation, they're not going to die.<br/>Take courage now brethren, close in your ranks.<br/>Stand on the promise, giving God thanks.<br/>For Satan will fi ght us, or surely will try,<br/>But he can't beat a people who are not going to die.</lines>
