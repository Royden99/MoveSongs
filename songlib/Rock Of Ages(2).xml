    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Rock of Ages, You are faithful and true;<br/>You are able to do all You have promised.<br/>Rock of Ages, You are faithful and just; <br/>I will always put my trust in You.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>You're a shelter in the time of trouble;<br/>You're a refuge in the time of storm.<br/>You're a fortress in the time of struggle;<br/>And a tower in the time of war.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>You're a healer in the time of sickness;<br/>You're a comfort in the time of grief.<br/>You're a stronghold in the time of weakness<br/>And a helper in the time of need.</lines>
