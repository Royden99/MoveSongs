    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Can you hear the sound of heaven<br/>Like the sound of many waters?<br/>It's the sound of worship<br/>Coming from the throne:<br/>Cries of adoration<br/>As men from every nation<br/>Lift their voice to make His glory known, singing</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Holy, holy, holy are You, Lord,<br/>Holy, holy, holy are You, Lord;<br/>The elders and angels bow,<br/>The redeemed worship You now;<br/>Holy, holy, holy are You, Lord.<br/></lines>
