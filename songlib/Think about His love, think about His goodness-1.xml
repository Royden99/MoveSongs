    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Think about His love, <br/>Think about His goodness, <br/>Think about His grace<br/>That has brought us through. <br/>For as high as the heavens above, <br/>So great is the measure of our Father's love. <br/>Great is the measure of our Father's love. </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>How could I forget His mercy, <br/>How could I forget His love?<br/>He satisfies, He satisfies, He satisfies all my desire.<br/>Great is the measure of our Father's love.</lines>
