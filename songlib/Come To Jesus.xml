    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Weak and wounded sinner,<br/>Lost and left to die.<br/>Raise your head for love is passing by.<br/>Come to Jesus.<br/>Come to Jesus.<br/>Come to Jesus,<br/>And live.<br/>Now your burden's lifted,<br/>And carried far away.<br/>And precious blood has washed away the stain.<br/>Sing to Jesus.<br/>Sing to Jesus.<br/>Sing to Jesus,<br/>And live.<br/>Like a new born baby,<br/>Don't be afraid to crawl.<br/>And remember when you walk sometimes we fall.<br/>Fall on Jesus.<br/>Fall on Jesus.<br/>Fall on Jesus,<br/>And live.<br/>When the love spills over,<br/>And music fills the night.<br/>And when you can't contain your joy inside.<br/>Dance with Jesus.<br/>Dance with Jesus.<br/>Dance with Jesus,<br/>And live.<br/>With your final heartbeat,<br/>Kiss the world goodbye.<br/>And go in peace, and laugh on glory's side.<br/>Fly to Jesus.<br/>Fly to Jesus.<br/>Fly to Jesus,<br/>And live.</lines>
