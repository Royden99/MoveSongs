    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When I was younger I would gird myself<br/>And would go wherever I wanted to.<br/>But now, I'm older, and I stretch out my hands and cry,<br/>And I cry...</lines>

    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I thank Christ Jesus our Lord and King<br/>Who hath enabled me, for that He counts me faithful,<br/>Putting me into His service, who was not one of His<br/>Yet I cry...</lines>
