    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He has called us to a secret place<br/>Separated from the rest of the world,<br/>He has called us to a silent place<br/>Where all other voices are stilled,<br/>He has called us to a peaceful place,<br/>And there on bended knee<br/>We will sit at the feet of Jesus,<br/>and say, 'O Lord, teach me'.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Teach me those things which have been hidden<br/>Since the beginning of the world,<br/>Teach me those things which man has longed to know<br/>And yet has never seen,<br/>Teach me those things which are Thy nature,<br/>Teach me those things which are Thy way,<br/>And draw me, Lord, oh draw me close to Thee!<br/></lines>
