    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Here I am, wholly available<br/>As for me, I will serve the Lord,<br/>Here I am, wholly available<br/>As for me, I will serve the Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The fields are white unto harvest,<br/>But oh, the labourers are so few,<br/>So Lord, I give myself to help the reaping,<br/>To gather precious souls unto You.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The time is right in the nation<br/>For works of power and authority,<br/>God's looking for a people who are willing<br/>To be counted in His glorious victory.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>As salt are we ready to savour?<br/>In darkness are we ready to be light?<br/>God's seeking out a very special people<br/>To manifest His truth and His might.<br/></lines>
