    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Thanks be to God,<br/>Who leads us in His triumph!<br/>Thanks be to God,<br/>Who's got the victory! (2x)<br/>We have overcome the world<br/>By the blood of the Lamb,<br/>And loving not our lives<br/>Even unto death.<br/>The word of our testimony<br/>Tells the world about His love,<br/>As we shout unto the nations,<br/>“He is coming back!<br/>Oh, He is coming back!”<br/>Through the blood of our Savior<br/>We are set free from the curse,<br/>Jesus is the one and only<br/>Lasting sacrifi ce!<br/>He has conquered Satan's power<br/>No more shall we be ashamed,<br/>Just as He defeated death,<br/>We shall do the same,<br/>Oh, we shall do the same.</lines>
