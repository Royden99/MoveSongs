    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In the presence of Jehovah<br/>God almighty, Prince of Peace<br/>Troubles vanish, hearts are mended<br/>In the presence of the King<br/>**<br/>In His presence, in his holy presence<br/>The weary can find perfect rest the broken are restored<br/>In His presence, in his holy presence<br/>There's nothing like the presence of the Lord.</lines>
