    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>Rejoice, rejoice, for the marriage is come at last!<br/>Rejoice, rejoice, and be exceedingly glad,<br/>And shout the victory<br/>Of joy eternally<br/>Of love unknown before on the earth.<br/>The marriage of the Lamb is come.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Lo, winter is past and the rain is o'er and gone,<br/>And the flowers appear on the earth,<br/>And the time of the singing of the birds is come,<br/>And the voice of the dove is heard.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>As the Bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride.<br/>So shall thy God rejoice over thee.<br/>And oh, oh the joy when the manchild at last<br/>Shall bring in the year of Jubilee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Then the love of the Father is not in him.<br/>For the cravings of this sinful man,<br/>The lust, the pride within,<br/>Cometh not from the Father, but from sin<br/>And darkness of this world.<br/>So He calls His people out to live<br/>Holy by His word.</lines>
    </verse>
