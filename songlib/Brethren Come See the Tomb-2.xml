    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Brethren, come see the tomb where Jesus lay;<br/>The stone's been rolled away, <br/>The stone's been rolled away. <br/>Death could not hold Him, much less the grave, <br/>Since that stone's been rolled away. </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And now He's risen, and now He's reigning, <br/>And within my heart He's singing songs of praise.<br/>And now He's risen, and now He's reigning, <br/>Since that stone's been rolled away. </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Lord roll that stone away; <br/>Release me from that grave. <br/>Make this hardened heart of mine<br/>Soft as potter's clay, <br/>And, Oh Lord, shed abroad <br/>This precious love of God. <br/>Oh Lord, roll that stone away.</lines>
