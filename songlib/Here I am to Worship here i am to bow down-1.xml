    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Light of the world,<br/>You stepped down into darkness,<br/>Opened my eyes, let me see.<br/>Beauty that made this heart adore You,<br/>Hope of a life spent with You,</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>So here I am to worship,<br/>Here I am to bow down,<br/>Here I am to say that You're my God.<br/>You're altogether lovely,<br/>Altogether worthy,<br/>Altogether wonderful to me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>King of all days, oh so highly exalted,<br/>Glorious in heaven above;<br/>Humbly You came to the earth You created,<br/>All for love's sake became poor,<br/>So ...</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>And I'll never know how much it cost<br/>To see my sin upon that cross,<br/>And I'll never know how much it cost<br/>To see my sin upon that cross<br/>So ...<br/></lines>
