    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The champion marched for forty days<br/>Sayin', Send me a man to fight!<br/>The Israelites said, I've got a brave heart,<br/>But my feet are full of fright!<br/>A boy with a sling and pocket full of rocks<br/>Who know how to trust and pray<br/>If you're gonna run, Goliath, you better run now,<br/>Cause I came here to stay.<br/>Chorus:<br/>Run if you want to; run if you will;<br/>But, I came here to stay.<br/>If I fall down, I'm gonna get up.<br/>I didn't start out to play.<br/>It's a battlefield, brother,<br/>Not a recreation room.<br/>It's a fight and not a game.<br/>Run if you want to; run if you will;<br/>But, I came here to stay.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The boys wouldn't bow,<br/>And the king got mad.<br/>So he said, Turn the furnace up high.<br/>Tie 'em up and throw 'em in.<br/>These Hebrew boys are gonna fry.<br/>A little while later he looked in the flame;<br/>He heard Shadrach say,<br/>Pull up a chair, boys, and warm your hands<br/>'Cause we came here to stay.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The decree had been signed by the hand of the king;<br/>But, Daniel still talked to the Lord.<br/>Hungry lions were pacing their den,<br/>Here comes supper, one roared.<br/>But, if you'd been around anywhere close<br/>You'd have heard Daniel say,<br/>If you're talking 'bout me, you can forget it, boys<br/>'Cause I came here to stay.</lines>
