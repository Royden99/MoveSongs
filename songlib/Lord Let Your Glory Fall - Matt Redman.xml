    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Lord, let Your glory fall,  as on that ancient day,<br/> songs of enduring love,  and then Your glory came.<br/> And as a sign to You,  that we would love the same,<br/> our hearts will sing that song:  God, let Your glory come.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>You are good, You are good,  and Your love endures.<br/> You are good, You are good,  and Your love endures.<br/> You are good, You are good,  and Your love endures today.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Voices in unison,  giving You thanks and praise,<br/> joined by the instruments,  and then Your glory came.<br/> Your presence like a cloud,  upon that ancient day,<br/> the priests were overwhelmed,  because Your glory came.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Oh, Your anger lasts a moment,  but your favor lasts a lifetime.<br/> Yeah, yeah.<br/> A sacrifice was made,<br/> and then Your fire came;<br/> they knelt upon the ground,<br/> and with one voice they praised.<br/> They sang, “Come, Lord.<br/> Lord, let Your glory fall,<br/> let You glory fall. Come, Lord Jesus.”</lines>
