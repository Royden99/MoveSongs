    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Get your mind off of yourself,<br/>And get it on Me.<br/>Don't you know that I have come<br/>That you might be free.<br/>Stop walking around so full of doubt.<br/>Just have the faith that He'll bring you out.<br/>Get your mind off of yourself,<br/>And get it on Me.</lines>
