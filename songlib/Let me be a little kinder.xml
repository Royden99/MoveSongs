    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Let me be a little kinder, let me be a little blinder,<br/>To the faults of those around me, let me praise a little  more.<br/>Let me be when I am weary, just a little bit more cheery<br/>Think a little more of others, and a little less of me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Let me be a little braver, when temptation bids me waver,<br/>Let me strive a little harder, to be all I should be.<br/>Let me be a little meeker, with my brother that may be weaker,<br/>Let me think more of my neighbor, and a whole lot less of me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Let me be when I am weary, just a little bit more cheery<br/>Let me serve a whole lot better, those that I am praying for<br/>Let me be a little meeker, with my brother who is weaker<br/>Let me think more of others, and a whole lot less of me</lines>
