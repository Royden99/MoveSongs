    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Glory to God!  He lifted me up!<br/>He lifted me up, I know!<br/>He reached out His hand, and He lifted me up,<br/>And that's why I love Him so.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I love Him more and more,<br/>I love Him more and more,<br/>And when at last I reach the other shore,<br/>I'll praise Him more and more.<br/></lines>
