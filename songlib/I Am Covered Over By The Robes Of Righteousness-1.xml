    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I am covered over by the robes of righteousness<br/>That Jesus gives to me, he gives to me.<br/>I am covered over by the precious blood of Jesus<br/>And He lives in me, lives in me.<br/>What a joy it is to know my Heavenly Father loves me so<br/>He sets me free, sets me free.<br/>When He looks at me He sees not what I used to be<br/>But He sees Jesus.</lines>
