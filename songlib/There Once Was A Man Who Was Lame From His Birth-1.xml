    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There once was a man who was lame from his birth,<br/>In the gate of the temple he lay.<br/>He was begging for money as he lay on the earth<br/>From all who would pass by his way.<br/>Then two disciples of Jesus named Peter and John<br/>Came and looked him straight in the eye.<br/>They said, We don't have money,<br/>But we'll give you the only thing<br/>That all of your money can't buy.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And he went a-walking and a-leaping and a-praising God.<br/>In the name of the Lord he was healed.<br/>He went a-walking and a-leaping and a-praising God.<br/>For the power of God is so real.<br/>He went a-walking and a-leaping and a-praising God,<br/>And that's the way that I feel!<br/>And he went a-walking and a-leaping and a-praising God.<br/>In the name of the Lord he was healed.</lines>
