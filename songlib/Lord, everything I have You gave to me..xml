    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Lord, everything I have You gave to me.<br/>There is nothing that compares to Your love and liberty.<br/>In my darkness You're the Light, and You shine through me.<br/>You come and break my chains, and You make me free.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>You do all things well.<br/>Lord, this is my declaration.<br/>You can do nothing but good,<br/>When my heart belongs to You.<br/>You won't lead me astray.<br/>Where I go Your hand will guide me.<br/>Whatever my state, may my heart always say<br/>You do all things well.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And in the trial of my faith, You strengthen me.<br/>When questions arise, You hear me.<br/>When I feel like thirsty ground, You flow through me.<br/>Though I fail to understand, You help me see.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
