    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>My hope is built on nothing less<br/>Than Jesus' blood and righteousness.<br/>I dare not trust the sweetest frame,<br/>But wholly lean on Jesus' name.<br/>Chorus:<br/>On Christ the solid Rock I stand;<br/>All other ground is sinking sand.<br/>All other ground is sinking sand.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>His oath, His covenant, His blood,<br/>Support me in the whelming flood.<br/>When all around my soul gives way,<br/>He then is all my hope and stay.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>When darkness seeks to hide His face,<br/>I rest on His unchanging grace.<br/>Through every high and stormy gale,<br/>My anchor holds within the veil.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>When He shall come with trumpet sound,<br/>O, may I then in Him be found,<br/>Dressed in His righteousness alone,<br/>Faultless to stand before the throne.</lines>
    </verse>
