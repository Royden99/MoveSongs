    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>If you make the Most High your dwelling.<br/>If you make the Most High your God.<br/>If you make the Most High your dwelling.<br/>If you make the Most High your God.<br/>You'll not fear the terrors of night;<br/>the pestilence that stalks in the darkness.<br/>Thousands shall fall by your side and at your right hand.<br/>But the Lord will uphold you. Under His wings will enfold you.<br/>By His hands He will lead you, if you're trusting Him.<br/>If you're trusting in Him.</lines>
