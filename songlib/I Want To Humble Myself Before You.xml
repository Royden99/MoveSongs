    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Oh God, I ask You today<br/>Open my eyes to see who I am.<br/>Let Your Spirit quide me to understand<br/>That only humbled I will follow You.<br/>Chorus:<br/>I want to humble myself before You.<br/>I want to feel your presense in me,<br/>Because I know that I cannot live<br/>If I don't have a broken heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>All of my life to the altar I bring,<br/>Here is my praise, my offering.<br/>In paths of justice I want to walk,<br/>And be perfect in Your sight.</lines>
