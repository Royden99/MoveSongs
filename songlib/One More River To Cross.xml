    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>One more river to cross,<br/>One more mountain to climb,<br/>One more valley I've got to go through,<br/>Leaving this world behind,<br/>One more battle with the devil,<br/>I want him to understand<br/>That I'm going through with Jesus, hallelujah,<br/>Holding to His nail scarred hand.</lines>
