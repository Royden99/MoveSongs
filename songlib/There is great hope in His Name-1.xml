    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There is great hope in His name! <br/>There is power to heal the sick and the lame. <br/>He will mend the broken reed, <br/>Nurse the dying wick to flame. <br/>There is great, great hope, <br/>There is great, great power, <br/>There is great hope and power in His name!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>There is great hope in His name!<br/>We shall never be the same.<br/>For the love that conquers fear<br/>Brings a bit of heaven here.<br/>There is great, great hope,<br/>There is great, great power,<br/>There is great hope and power in His name!</lines>
