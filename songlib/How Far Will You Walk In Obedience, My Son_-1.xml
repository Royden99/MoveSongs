    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>How far will you walk in obedience, my son?<br/>All the way, all the way to the cross.<br/>I desire Thy will and not my own,<br/>All the way, all the way to the cross.<br/>My steps are ordered and planned by Thee.<br/>You know the way that I cannot see.<br/>Hold my hand, Lord, and walk with me,<br/>All the way, all the way to the cross.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>How far will you walk in submission, my son? etc.<br/>How far will you walk in the wilderness, my son? etc.<br/>How far will you walk in forgiveness, my son? etc.</lines>
