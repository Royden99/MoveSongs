    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>A better person I'd like to be,<br/>A vessel of honor for the world to see.<br/>Just clay am I in my Master's hand,<br/>Willing to be what my Lord commands.<br/>Chorus:<br/>I will not resist the Potter's hand,<br/>I will not resist the Potter's hand,<br/>For He is fashioning and forming me.<br/>He's changing me, He heard my plea,<br/>He's changing me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>But when the trials and testings come,<br/>I start to fight and I try to run.<br/>Lord, help me know you've just begun<br/>To mould this clay to reveal Your Son.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I'll yield to Him whate'er the cost,<br/>For life is more than gain or loss.<br/>It matters not how rich I am,<br/>Only if I'm yielded fully to His plan.</lines>
    </verse>
