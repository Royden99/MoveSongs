    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>You are the peace that guards my heart,<br/>My help in times of need,<br/>You are the hope that leads me on<br/>And brings me to my knees,<br/>For there I find You waiting, and there I find release<br/>So with all my heart I'll worship<br/>And unto You I'll sing.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>For You alone deserve all glory,<br/>For You alone deserve all praise.<br/>Father, we worship and adore You,<br/>Father, we long to see Your face,<br/>For You alone deserve all glory,<br/>For You alone deserve all praise,<br/>Father we love You and we worship You this day.<br/></lines>
