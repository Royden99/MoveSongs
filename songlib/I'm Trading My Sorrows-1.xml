    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I'm trading my sorrow. I'm trading my shame.<br/>I'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord.<br/>I'm trading my sickness. I'm trading my pain.<br/>I'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord.<br/>Chorus:<br/>And we say, Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes, yes Lord.<br/>Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes, yes Lord.<br/>Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes, yes Lord, Amen.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>You have turned my mourning into dancing.<br/>You have turned my sorrow into joy.<br/>You have turned my mourning into dancing.<br/>You have turned my sorrow into joy.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>(With hands raised:)<br/>This is how we overcome. This is how we overcome.<br/>This is how we overcome. This is how we overcome.</lines>
