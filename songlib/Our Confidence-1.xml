    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Our confidence is in the Lord,<br/>The source of our salvation.<br/>Rest is found in Him alone,<br/>The author of creation.<br/>We will not fear the evil day<br/>Because we have a refuge.<br/>In every circumstance we say<br/>Our hope is built on Jesus.<br/>He is our fortress,<br/>We will never be shaken,<br/>He is our fortress,<br/>We will never be shaken.<br/>We will put our trust in God,<br/>We will put our trust in God.<br/></lines>
