    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Brightest and best of the sons of the morning,<br/>Dawn on our darkness and lend us Thine aid;<br/>Star of the East, the horizon adorning,<br/>Guide where our infant Redeemer is laid.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Cold on His cradle the dewdrops are shining;<br/>Low lies His head with the beasts of the stall;<br/>Angels adore Him in slumber reclining,<br/>Maker and Monarch and Saviour of all!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Say, shall we yield Him, in costly devotion,<br/>Odours of Edom and offerings divine?<br/>Gems of the mountain and pearls of the ocean,<br/>Myrrh from the forest, or gold from the mine?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Vainly we offer each ample oblation,<br/>Vainly with gifts would His favour secure;<br/>Richer by far is the heart's adoration,<br/>Dearer to God are the prayers of the poor.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
