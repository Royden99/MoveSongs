    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When I see a brother standing like a mountain,<br/>When I see a sister glowing like a fire,<br/>Something inside me like a bubbling fountain,<br/>Quickens my faith, makes me want to take<br/>Just…another step higher –</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>(chorus) <br/> 'Cause I know <br/>If He did it for them God will do it for me<br/>He'll break the bonds, right the wrongs and set me free,<br/>O, if He did it for them, God will do it for me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>When I see a brother who's been through a battle<br/>Lifting his hands in a victory song<br/>A sister who knows what it is to be shackled<br/>Stand and proclaim, that in Jesus' name<br/>She's free once again-</lines>
