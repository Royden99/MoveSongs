    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There is a path which no fowl knoweth,<br/>The vulture's eye hath never seen.<br/>Where no thorn tree nor thistle groweth,<br/>No hedge to hinder completely clean.<br/>Chorus:<br/>High in the mountain, above earth's stormy sphere,<br/>Above the heaven's coral plain.<br/>It's paved with gold and precious stones so dear.<br/>It leads to love, the highest gain.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>To walk this path there is a cross to bear.<br/>But at the end there is a crown to wear.<br/>A crown of life and love unheard before,<br/>When we have passed o'er on the other shore.</lines>
