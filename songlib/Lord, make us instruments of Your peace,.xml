    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Lord, make us instruments of Your peace,<br/>Where there is hatred, let Your love increase,<br/>Lord, make us instruments of Your peace,<br/>Walls of pride and prejudice shall cease<br/>When we are Your instruments of peace.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Where there is hatred, we will show His love,<br/>Where there is injury, we will never judge,<br/>Where there is striving, we will speak His peace<br/>To the millions crying for release,<br/>We will be His instruments of peace.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Lord, make us instruments of Your peace,<br/>Where there is hatred, let Your love increase,<br/>Lord, make us instruments of Your peace,<br/>Walls of pride and prejudice shall cease<br/>When we are Your instruments of peace.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Where there is blindness, we will pray for sight,<br/>Where there is darkness, we will shine His light,<br/>Where there is sadness, we will bear their grief,<br/>To the millions crying for relief,<br/>We will be Your instruments of peace.<br/></lines>
