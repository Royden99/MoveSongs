    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Come close to me, too close for words,<br/>And still my beating heart.<br/>I find your thoughts without one glance,<br/>We're going all the way.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>With you I'm washed as white as the snow<br/>And all crimson stains become just a shadow.<br/>You know I would be blind without you<br/>So light up my way to find my way home.<br/>Today, today, today, we're going all the way.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Tears sometimes fall upon my face<br/>And join the oil of gladness.<br/>How can it be I've found this love?<br/>A love that lets me fly.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
