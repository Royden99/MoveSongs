    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There's never a reason strong enough <br/>To ever stop praising the Lord. <br/> Whenever the going's getting tough,<br/>You gotta keep praising the Lord.<br/> Praise Him, you know that you should. <br/>For all things work together for good. <br/>Praise Him, you can never afford <br/>To ever stop praising the Lord.</lines>
