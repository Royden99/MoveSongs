    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Living under the shadow of His wing,<br/>We find security.<br/>Standing in His presence we will bring<br/>Our worship, worship, worship to the King.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Bowed in adoration at His feet,<br/>We dwell in harmony.<br/>Voices joined together that repeat<br/>Worthy, worthy, worthy is the Lamb.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Heart to heart embracing in His love,<br/>Reveals His purity,<br/>Soaring in my Spirit like a dove,<br/>Holy, holy, holy is the Lord.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
