    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Christ, come forth in me<br/>Till my life I no longer can see,<br/>Till the day breaks forth and the darkness is gone.<br/>Christ, come forth in me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Give me silver till I need no more,<br/>That my redemption may be fully restored.<br/>That the whole world may know that it's no longer I,<br/>But Christ that liveth in me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Give me silver till I need no more,<br/>That my redemption may be fully restored.<br/>That the price may be paid, till I am overlaid<br/>Both inside and outside with gold.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>As I stand in the Name of the Song,<br/>And that work has been completely done,<br/>Lay me down on the cross, counting all else as loss,<br/>Till God comes forth in me.</lines>
