    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>All down through the ages<br/>God has had a plan<br/>To have a place to dwell in,<br/>A house not made with hands;<br/>He’s taken<br/>One from a city<br/>And two from a family,<br/>Now He’s shaping them and placing them<br/>For eternity.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>We are living stones,<br/>Being joined together;<br/>We are living stones,<br/>A city for our God.<br/>Rejoice and be glad,<br/>The building’s almost over<br/>And He’s chosen you and me,<br/>To be in His master plan.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Jesus is the pattern,<br/>He is the cornerstone;<br/>He let the Father shape Him<br/>As the blueprint for His home,<br/>But God doesn’t want just one stone,<br/>He needs a whole lot more,<br/>Now He’s shaping them and placing them;<br/>That’s what we came here for.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>BRIDGE<br/>Glory, glory,<br/>He wants to fill it with His …<br/></lines>
