    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>All I once held dear, built my life upon<br/>All this world reveres, and wars to own<br/>All I once thought gain I have counted loss<br/>Spent and worthless now, compared to this</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Knowing you, Jesus, knowing you, <br/>There is no greater thing<br/>You're my all, you're my rest<br/>You're my joy, my righteousness<br/>And I love you, Lord</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Now my heart's desire is to know you more<br/>To be found in you and known as yours<br/>To possess by faith what I could not earn<br/>All-surpassing gift of righteousness</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Oh, to know the power of your risen life<br/>And to know You in Your sufferings<br/>To become like you in your death, my Lord<br/>So with you to live and never die</lines>
