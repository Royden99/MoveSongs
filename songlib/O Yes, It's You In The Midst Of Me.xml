    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O yes, it's You in the midst of me.<br/>You're the water running free<br/>Around the tree of my city.<br/>O, You're the Lamb who is the light.<br/>There's no more night; all the tears are gone,<br/>And the sorrow has flown<br/>To the Christ in the midst of me.</lines>
