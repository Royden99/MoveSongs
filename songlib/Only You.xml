    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Only You, You alone are worthy of the glory, Lord<br/>Every crown we'll ever wear, we lay it down<br/>We bow our knee, we confess, You are Lord all by yourself<br/>You reign alone, upon Your throne of righteousness<br/>Only You</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Who is like the Lord our God, who reigns in majesty?<br/>Who formed the earth and the heavens above--the mountains, deserts, and seas?<br/>Who deserves honor and who deserves praise<br/>and who is the sovereign king?<br/>Only You...</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Who is like the Lord our God? <br/>Who lifts those of low degree <br/>And who by His grace and faithfulness <br/>He calls us His family? <br/>And who deserves honor? <br/>And who deserves praise? <br/>And who is the sovereign King?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>We cry holy is the Lord <br/>We cry worthy is the Lamb <br/>We cry holy is the Lord <br/>We exalt the great I Am</lines>
