    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He whom the Son sets free is free indeed<br/>Completely liberated from the curse of the law.<br/>He whom the Son sets free is free indeed.<br/>He's free to be a servant of the most high God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty,<br/>And I am not entangled with the yoke of slavery.<br/>For Jesus is the Truth who has come to set us free.<br/>We are free. We are free. We are free.</lines>
