      <lines>You are the words and the music. <br/>        You are the song that I sing. <br/>You are the melody, You are the harmony.<br/>Praise to Your name I will bring. <br/>You are Almighty God, You are the<br/>Lord of lords, You are the King of kings. <br/>Now I return to You the song that You gave to me. <br/>You are the song that I sing.</lines>
