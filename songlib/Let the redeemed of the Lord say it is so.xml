    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Let the redeemed of the Lord say it is so<br/>Let them declare His goodness in the land of the living<br/>Let the redeemed of the Lord say it so<br/>I am redeemed, I'm redeemed praise the Lord<br/>You who are weary and faint, wait on the Lord<br/>You will run and be strong, you will rise on eagle's wings<br/>Speak unto the dry bones "Now hear the word of the Lord"<br/>"You shall live, you shall live!" says the Lord<br/>O barren one sing and break forth into joy<br/>(For) you shall be fruitful and you shall multiply<br/>Rejoice desert places, you desolate lands be glad<br/>From you living water will flow, you will not thirst again<br/>Take courage you fearful of heart for your God comes to save<br/>Blind eyes will see and the lame will leap for joy<br/>The ransomed of God shall return unto Zion with songs<br/>Sorrow and sighing shall all flee away<br/></lines>
