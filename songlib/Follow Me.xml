    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I travelled down that lonely road,<br/>And no one seemed to care.<br/>The burden of my heavy load<br/>Was more than I could bare.<br/>I oft' complained to Jesus<br/>How others treated me,<br/>And then I heard him whisper<br/>Follow Me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>My feet were O so weary<br/>Upon the Calvary road.<br/>My burden was so heavy<br/>I bowed beneath the load.<br/>Be faithful weary pilgrim;<br/>The city I can see.<br/>Take up you cross and follow;<br/>Follow Me.</lines>
    </verse>
