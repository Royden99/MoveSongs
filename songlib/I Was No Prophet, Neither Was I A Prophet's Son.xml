    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son<br/>I was a herdsman and a gatherer of fruit<br/>And the Lord took me, as I followed the flock<br/>And the Lord said unto me<br/>Go prophecy unto my people, Israel<br/>Go prophecy unto my people, go thou now and tell<br/>There's a famine coming upon the earth<br/>And it's not of bread and it's not of thirst<br/>There's a famine coming upon the earth<br/>It's of hearing the words of the Lord.</lines>
