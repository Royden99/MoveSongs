    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>A sign shall be given a virgin will conceive<br/>A human baby bearing undiminished deity<br/>The glory of the nations a light for all to see<br/>That hope for all who will embrace His warm reality</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Immanuel our God is with us<br/>And if God is with us who could stand against us<br/>Our God is with us<br/>Immanuel</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>For all those who live in the shadow of death<br/>A glorious light has dawned<br/>For all those who stumble in the darkness<br/>Behold your light has come<br/>So what will be Your answer? Will You hear the call?<br/>Of Him who did not spare His son but gave Him for us all<br/>On earth there is no power there is no depth or height<br/>That could ever separate us from the love of God in Christ<br/></lines>
