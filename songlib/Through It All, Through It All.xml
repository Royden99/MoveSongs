    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I've had many tears and sorrows.<br/>I've had questions for tomorrow.<br/>There was a time I didn't know right from wrong.<br/>But in every situation<br/>God gave blessed consolation<br/>That my trials come to only make me strong.<br/>Chorus:<br/>Through it all, through it all<br/>O, I've learned to trust in Jesus.<br/>I've learned to trust in God<br/>Through it all, through it all.<br/>O, I've learned to depend on His word.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I thank God for the mountains<br/>And I thank Him for the valleys.<br/>I thank Him for the storms He brought me through.<br/>For if I'd never had a problem<br/>I wouldn't know that He could solve them.<br/>I'd never know what faith in God could do.</lines>
