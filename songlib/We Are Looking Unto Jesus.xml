    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We are looking unto Jesus<br/>The Author and Finisher of our faith. (2x)<br/>Who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross,<br/>Despising the shame, and is set down at the throne of God.<br/>Other foundation has no man laid<br/>Than that which is already laid.<br/>We are looking unto Jesus<br/>The Author and Finisher of our faith.</lines>
