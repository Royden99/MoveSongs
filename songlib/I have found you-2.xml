    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I have found You faithful, Oh Lord,<br/>Faithful unto me.<br/>I have found You faithful, Oh King, <br/>Complete this work, this work in me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>My heart is fixed, Oh Lord. I will praise Thee. <br/>My mind is set, Oh Lord, to give Thee thanks.<br/>No matter how You deal, we see You faithful,<br/>For we are holding fast to Thee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Thy loving kindness, Lord, reached the heavens,<br/>And now it reaches where we stand.<br/>And though You give, and choose to take away,<br/>We will not cease to bless your name.</lines>
