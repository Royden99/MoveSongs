    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>We say yes to the will of our Father,<br/>Yes to the love of His Son,<br/>And as He speaks to us from His holy word,<br/>Do we trust enough to do all that we've heard?<br/>And when He promises,<br/>Do we believe that He is able?<br/>Yes. (Yes.) Yes. (Yes.) Yes. (Yes.)</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>To the Spirit's call, we need not fear at all,<br/>When we start by saying,</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Harden not your hearts in giving all you are,<br/>Start by saying,</lines>
