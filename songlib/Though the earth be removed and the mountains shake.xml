    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Though the earth be removed and the mountains shake<br/>Though the waters roar and the nations rage<br/>I will stand still and see your salvation, Lord<br/>For you make all wars to cease</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The Lord of Hosts is with us<br/>The Lord of Hosts is with us<br/>The God of Jacob is our refuge<br/>He's our very present help<br/>Be still and know the Great I AM<br/>The Lord of Hosts is with us<br/>Be still and know the Great I AM<br/>The Lord of Hosts is here.<br/></lines>
