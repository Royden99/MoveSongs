    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I'll follow Thee, I'll follow thee, I'll follow Thee.<br/>I will sell all that I have and follow Thee. <br/>Deny myself, take up my Cross,<br/>And follow Thee, and follow Thee, and follow Thee.</lines>

    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Be one with Me, be one with Me, be one with Me.<br/>Thou art all fair and there is no spot in Thee. <br/>Rise up, my love, and come away.<br/>Be one with Me, be one with Me, be one with Me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I come to Thee, I come to Thee, I come to Thee.<br/>Thou whom my soul dearly loveth, I come to Thee. <br/>I'll hold Thee fast and not let Thee go<br/>Till we are one, I in you, and you in me.</lines>
