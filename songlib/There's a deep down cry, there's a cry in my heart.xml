      <lines>There's a deep down cry, there's a cry in my heart<br/>To be free from sin and death.  (2)<br/>Open my eyes to behold the things you're doing in the earth<br/>Open my ears that I might hear Your voice so still<br/>Open my eyes to behold the things You're doing in the earth<br/>There's a deep down cry to be free, <br/>To be free, to be free,  There's a deep down cry to be free.(2)</lines>
