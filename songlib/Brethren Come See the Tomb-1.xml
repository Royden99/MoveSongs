    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Brethren, come see the tomb where Jesus lay,<br/>That stone's been rolled away,<br/>That stone's been rolled away,<br/>Death could not hold Him, much less the grave,<br/>Oh, that stone's been rolled away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And now He's risen, and now He's reigning,<br/>From within my heart I'm singing songs of praise,<br/>And now He's risen, and now He's reigning,<br/>Oh, that stone's been rolled away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Lord, roll that stone away,<br/>Release me from this grave,<br/>Make this hardened heart of mine<br/>Soft as potter's clay,<br/>Oh, Lord, shed abroad<br/>The precious love of God,<br/>Oh, Lord, roll that stone away.<br/></lines>
