    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I shall walk in the light as He is in the light,<br/>I shall walk in the light as He is in the light,<br/>My delight is in the law of the Lord,<br/>And in His law do I meditate day and night.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I shall be like a tree<br/>Planted by the rivers of water<br/>That bringeth forth its fruit in its season;<br/>My leaf shall not wither,<br/>Whatsoever I do shall prosper,<br/>And whatsoever I do shall prosper.<br/></lines>
