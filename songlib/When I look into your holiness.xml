    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When I look into Your holiness<br/>When I gaze into Your loveliness<br/>When all things that surround<br/>Become shadows in the light of You ...</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I worship You, I worship You.<br/>The reason I live is to worship You.<br/>I worship You, I worship You.<br/>The reason I live is to worship You.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>When I've found the joy of reaching Your heart<br/>When my will becomes enthralled in Your love<br/>When all things that surround<br/>Become shadows in the light of You ...<br/></lines>
