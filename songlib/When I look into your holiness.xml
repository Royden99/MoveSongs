    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When I look into Your holiness, when I gaze into Your loveliness,<br/>	 When all things that surround me,<br/>           Become shadows in the light of You,<br/>	When I find the joy of reaching Your heart , <br/>           And my will becomes enthroned in Your love, <br/>           And the things that surround me, <br/>           Become shadows in the light of You,</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I worship You, I worship You. <br/>The reason I live is to worship You.<br/>I worship You, I worship You. <br/>The reason I live is to worship You.</lines>
