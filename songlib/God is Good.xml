    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>God is good all the time<br/>He put a song of praise in this heart of mine.<br/>God is good all the time.<br/>Through the darkest night, His light will shine.<br/>God is good, God is good all the time.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When you walking through the valley,<br/>And there are shadows all around.<br/>Do not fear, He will guide you,<br/>He will keep you safe and sound.<br/>He has promised to never leave you, <br/>Nor forsake you, and His Word is true.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>We were sinners so unworthy.<br/>Yet  for us He came to die.<br/>He filled us with the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now we can stand and testify<br/>That His love is everlasting,<br/>And His mercies, they will never end.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Though I may not understand,<br/>All the plans You have for me,<br/>My life is in His hands.<br/>And through the eyes of faith,<br/>I can clearly see.</lines>
