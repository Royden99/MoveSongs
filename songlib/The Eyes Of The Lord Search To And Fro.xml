    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The eyes of the Lord search to and fro,<br/>Throughout the world of our hearts,<br/>Looking for someone<br/>Who longs to live with Him,<br/>In righteousness, in majesty,<br/>With voices raised to sing.<br/>Chorus:<br/>Holy, holy, holy is the Lord.<br/>Holy, holy, holy is the Lord.<br/>(Substitute Worthy and Jesus for Holy.)</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The heart of the heavenly Father<br/>Seeks in every man<br/>One who will worship in Spirit and truth,<br/>Living their whole life<br/>Surrendered only to Him,<br/>In righteousness, in purity,<br/>With voices raised to sing.</lines>
