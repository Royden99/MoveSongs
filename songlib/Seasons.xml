    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Like the frost on a rose, Winter comes for us all<br/>Oh how nature acquaints us, With the nature of patience<br/>Like a seed in the snow, I’ve been buried to grow<br/>For Your promise is loyal, From seed to sequoia</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I know....Though the winter is long even richer<br/>The harvest it brings<br/>Though my waiting prolongs even greater<br/>Your promise for me like a seed<br/>I believe that my season will come</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Lord I think of Your love, Like the low winter sun<br/>As I gaze I am blinded, In the light of Your brightness<br/>Like a fire to the snow, I’m renewed in Your warmth<br/>Melt the ice of this wild soul, Till the barren is beautiful</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I can see the promise, I can see the future<br/>You’re the God of seasons, I’m just in the winter<br/>If all I know of harvest, Is that it’s worth my patience<br/>Then if You’re not done working, God I’m not done waiting</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>You can see my promise, Even in the winter<br/>Cause You’re the God of greatness, Even in a manger<br/>For all I know of seasons, Is that You take Your time<br/>You could have saved us in a second, Instead You sent a child</lines>
    </verse>
