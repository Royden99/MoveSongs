    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Christ was born to die<br/>To submit while they cried, crucify<br/>Now His purpose I see, is to fulfill it in me<br/>Christ was born to die.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>In the way of a ship on the sea<br/>Of a serpent, of an eagle so free<br/>Of a man with a maid, God's great purpose is laid<br/>In the way of a ship on the sea.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>To make of the twain one new man<br/>It's His purpose, it's His overall plan,<br/>To cleanse from within, one new man without sin<br/>To make of the twain one new man.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Ruth did glean in the field<br/>Till her kinsman did call her to yield<br/>Then a son came to be, that her people might be free<br/>Ruth did glean in the field.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>A woman arrayed with the sun <br/>In travail till the manchild is come<br/>The deliverer he'll be <br/>Who will set creation free<br/>A woman arrayed with the sun.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>To go and sell what we have<br/>To give to the poor for the great love of God<br/>To lay all on the cross<br/>And to count all things as loss<br/>To go and sell what we have.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>This is the way into life<br/>The calling of a man and his wife<br/>Into union they'll come<br/>That the manchild might be born.<br/>This is the way into life.</lines>
    </verse>
