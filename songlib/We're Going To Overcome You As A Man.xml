    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Jesus was in the wilderness, when He heard a voice that said.<br/>If you are the Son of God, then turn these stones to bread<br/>But He said, It is written, man shall not live just by bread.<br/>But by every word of God; by every word of God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>We're going to overcome you as a man<br/>We're going to overcome you as a man.<br/>You'd like it to be by some mystical power divine.<br/>But we're going to overcome you as a man.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>In these days the body is being tested and tried<br/>Tested and tried in every way for the Devil to turn aside.<br/>But we can't go any other way but the straight and narrow way.<br/>But the straight and narrow way; the straight and narrow way.</lines>
