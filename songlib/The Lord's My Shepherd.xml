    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>His yoke is easy, His burden is light<br/>I've found it so, I've found it so.<br/>He leadeth me by day and by night<br/>Where living waters flow.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want<br/>He maketh me down to lie, in pastures green,<br/>He leadeth me the quiet waters be.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>My soul crieth out, <br/>Restore me again and give me the<br/>Strength to take the narrow path of righteousness<br/>E'en for Thine Own Name's sake.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Yea, though I should walk the valley of death <br/>Yet what should I fear from ill? <br/>For Thou art with me, <br/>And Thy rod and staff support me still.</lines>
