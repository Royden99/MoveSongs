    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I can run through a troop, and leap over a wall,<br/>Hallelujah,<br/>With His strength and His sword the battle is won,<br/>Hallelujah,<br/>He's the rock of my salvation,<br/>There is no more condemnation,<br/>I can run through a troop and leap over a wall,<br/>Hallelujah.<br/></lines>
