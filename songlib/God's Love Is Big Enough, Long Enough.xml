    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>God's love is big enough, long enough<br/>God is strong enough to finish this work He has begun.<br/>He'll do exceedingly, abundantly above all we ask or think.<br/>To Him be glory in the church.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>So I will clap my hands, sing and shout;<br/>I will dance about, this body giving glory to the Lord.<br/>There is no foe too strong or tough, for God is big enough,<br/>And I will praise the Lord!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>You are the Lord of lords and King of kings,<br/>We lift our hands and sing.<br/>You are the precious Lamb of God.<br/>The Lord of lords and King of kings, Father unto You I sing.<br/>Yes, I will praise the Lord.</lines>
