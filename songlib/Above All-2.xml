    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Above all powers, above all kings,<br/>Above all nature and all created things,<br/>Above all wisdom and all the ways of man,<br/>You were here before the world began.<br/>Chorus:<br/>Crucified, laid behind a stone,<br/>You lived to die rejected and alone<br/>Like a rose trampled on the ground.<br/>You took the fall, and thought of me<br/>Above all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Above all kingdoms, above all thrones,<br/>Above all wonders the world has ever known<br/>Above all wealth, and treasures of the earth,<br/>There's no way to measure What You're worth.</lines>
    </verse>
