    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>A fountain springing up,<br/>A river flowing out,<br/>And whosoever will may come;<br/>The waters that I give you<br/>Are springing up within you,<br/>And you will never thirst again.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>A fountain springs up in the valley,<br/>Waters deep and crystal clear;<br/>My love for you is like that fountain<br/>And all my springs are in you.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The fountain flows into the river,<br/>Living waters running deep;<br/>The current's moving is so strong<br/>That it will flow eternally.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>And as we drink these living waters<br/>Our roots together go down deep,<br/>And we'll bear fruit in every season<br/>For we are planted like a tree.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
