    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I would have you to know, dearest brethren<br/>     And I speak without falseness or sham<br/>                That in Christ you are altogether beautiful<br/>                And I love you with all that I am.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>(Chorus)<br/>   So don't say you can't see the life in this<br/>   And don't show me the place where there's strife<br/>   For we're one and the same and I'm part of you<br/>   And without you I'd have no life.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Each day we are gathered together<br/>    And each day I may see you at your worst<br/>    But I find as I see through the eyes of faith<br/>    You become more like the One who loved me first.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>For now, I must look upon your nakedness<br/>    And for now, you must look upon mine<br/>    But as we are faithful to cover it<br/>    We'll be clothed in those garments divine</lines>
