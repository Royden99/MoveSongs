      <lines>Brethren, come see the tomb where Jesus lay,<br/>That stone's been rolled away,<br/>That stone's been rolled away,<br/>Death cannot hold Him, much less the grave<br/>Since that stone's been rolled away.<br/>And now He's risen, And now He's reigning,<br/>And from within my heart I'm singing songs of praise,<br/>And now He's risen And now He's reigning,<br/>Since that stone's been rolled away.<br/>Lord roll that stone away, Release me from this grave<br/>Make this hardened heart of mine<br/>Soft as potter's clay,<br/>And oh Lord, shed abroad, That precious love of God,<br/>Oh Lord, roll that stone away.</lines>
