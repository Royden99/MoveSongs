    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>It's Time for the Babes To Be Children<br/>It's time for the children to be sons<br/>Time for the sons to be fathers<br/>Time for God's people to be one.<br/>It's time for the fearful to take courage<br/>Time for the weak to be strong<br/>Time for God's people to gather.  <br/>Time for the Ark to move on.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Oh brethren, these are perilous times<br/>As the Lord by his servants has warned<br/>What be our answer, shall we turn aside<br/>Nay, but we shall arise and press on<br/>It's time for the Manchild to be born<br/>Time for the trumpet to sound<br/>Death still must be beaten<br/>Time, fellow soldiers, is now.</lines>
