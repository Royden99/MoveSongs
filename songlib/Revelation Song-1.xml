    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Worthy is the Lamb who was slain<br/>Holy, holy is He<br/>Sing a new song to Him who sits on<br/>Heaven's mercy seat<br/>Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty<br/>Who was and is and is to come<br/>With all creation I sing<br/>Praise to the King of kings<br/>You are my everything and I will adore You<br/>Filled with wonder, awestruck wonder<br/>At the mention of your name<br/>Jesus, Your name is power, breath and living water<br/>Such a marvelous mystery<br/></lines>
