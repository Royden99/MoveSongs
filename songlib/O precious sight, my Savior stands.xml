    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O precious sight, my Savior stands<br/>Dying for me with outstretched hands<br/>O precious sight, I love to gaze<br/>Remembering salvation's day<br/>Remembering salvation's day<br/>Though my eyes linger on this scene<br/>May passing time and years not steal<br/>The power with which it impacts me<br/>The freshness of its mystery<br/>The freshness of its mystery<br/>May I never lose the wonder<br/>The wonder of the cross<br/>May I see it like the first time<br/>Standing as a sinner lost<br/>Undone by mercy and left speechless<br/>Watching wide eyed at the cost<br/>May I never lose the wonder<br/>The wonder of the cross<br/>Behold the God-man crucified<br/>The perfect sinless sacrifice<br/>As blood ran down those nails and wood<br/>History was split in two<br/>History was split in two<br/>Behold the empty wooden tree<br/>His body gone, alive and free<br/>We sing with everlasting joy<br/>For sin and death they've been destroyed<br/>Sin and death they've been destroyed<br/></lines>
