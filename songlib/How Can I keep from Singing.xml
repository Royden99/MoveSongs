    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There is an endless song, Echoes in my soul<br/>I hear the music ring<br/>And though the storms may come<br/>I am holding on and To the rock I cling</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>How can I keep from singing Your praise<br/>How can I ever say enough<br/>How amazing is Your love<br/>How can I keep from shouting Your name<br/>I know I am loved by the King<br/>And it makes my heart want to sing</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I will lift my eyes In the darkest night<br/>For I know my Savior lives<br/>And I will walk with You<br/>Knowing You'll see me through<br/>And sing the songs You give</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I can sing in the troubled times<br/>Sing when I win<br/>I can sing when I lose my step<br/>And fall down again<br/>I can sing 'cause You pick me up<br/>Sing 'cause You're there<br/>I can sing 'cause You hear me, Lord<br/>When I call to You in prayer<br/>I can sing with my last breath<br/>Sing for I know<br/>That I'll sing with the angels<br/>And the saints around the throne</lines>
    </verse>
