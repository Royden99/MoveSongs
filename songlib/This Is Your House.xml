    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>This is your house, <br/>Father come and dwell <br/>This is your house, <br/>A holy house of prayer <br/>Where the lost and the lonely, <br/>bring their burdens and their cares <br/>This is your house, this is your house <br/>come and dwell</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>We dedicate this temple to you Lord <br/>Let your glory fill this sanctuary <br/>Be enthroned on the praises of your people <br/>Lord we agree, in unity.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Holy Spirit overflow this place <br/>Decorate our walls with grace and mercy <br/>Let healing and redemption, find searching souls <br/>Lord have your way, we humbly pray.</lines>
