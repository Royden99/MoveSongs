    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>A fountain springs up in the valley;<br/>Waters deep and crystal clear.<br/>My love for You is like that fountain,<br/>And my springs are all in You.<br/>Chorus:<br/>A fountain springing up,<br/>A river flowing out,<br/>And whosoever will may come,<br/>The waters that I give you,<br/>Are springing up within you,<br/>And you will never thirst again.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The fountain flows into the river,<br/>Living waters, running deep,<br/>The current moving is so strong,<br/>That it will flow eternally.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And as we drink these living waters,<br/>Our roots together go down deep.<br/>And we'll bear fruit in every season,<br/>For we are planted like a tree.</lines>
    </verse>
