    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>You did not wait for me, to draw near to You.<br/>But You clothed Yourself in frail humanity.<br/>You did not wait for me, to cry out to You.<br/>But You let me hear Your voice calling me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And I'm forever grateful to You.<br/>	And I'm forever grateful for the cross.<br/>	And I'm forever grateful to You<br/>	That You came to seek and save the lost.</lines>
