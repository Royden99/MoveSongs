    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Jesus Christ, I think upon Your sacrifice,<br/>You became nothing, poured out to death.<br/>Many times I've wondered at Your gift of life,<br/>And I'm in that place once again,<br/>I'm in that place once again.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And once again I look upon the cross where You died,<br/>I'm humbled by Your mercy and I'm broken inside.<br/>Once again I thank You,<br/>Once again I pour out my life.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Now You are exalted to the highest place,<br/>King of the heavens, where one day I'll bow.<br/>But for now, I marvel at this saving grace,<br/>And I'm full of praise once again.<br/>I'm full of praise once again.<br/>ENDING<br/>Thank You for the cross,<br/>Thank You for the cross,<br/>Thank You for the cross, my Friend.<br/>REPEAT<br/></lines>
