    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Lord, the light of Your love is shining,<br/>In the midst of the darkness, shining.<br/>Jesus, Light of the world shine upon us.<br/>Set us free by the truth You now bring us.<br/>Shine on me. Shine on me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Lord, I come into Your awesome presence,<br/>From the shadows into Your radiance.<br/>By Your blood I may enter Your brightness.<br/>Search me, try me, consume all my darkness.<br/>Shine on me. Shine on me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>As we gaze on Your kingly brightness,<br/>So our faces display Your likeness,<br/>Ever changing from glory to glory,<br/>Mirrored here may our lives tell the story.<br/>Shine on me. Shine on me.</lines>
