    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He led the captives out of the prison,<br/>He preached good tidings unto the weak.<br/>He gave the oil of joy for mourning<br/>He set the captives free,<br/>He set the captives free.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I will greatly rejoice, rejoice in my God,<br/>My soul shall be joyful, joyful in my God,<br/>He has covered me o'er with the robes of righteousness,<br/>He has clothed me with robes of salvation,<br/>He has clothed me with robes of salvation.<br/></lines>
