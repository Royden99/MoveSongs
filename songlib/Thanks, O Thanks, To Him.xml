    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Thanks, oh thanks to Him<br/>I need never ever sin,<br/>Jesus, by one sacrifice, for me<br/>Forever paid the price<br/>And now I have the sinless Christ within;<br/>And thanks to Him I need never ever sin.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Sin took charge when Adam fell,<br/>Rewarding men with death and hell,<br/>For sin and death upon all men had passed.<br/>Then into the world came God's own Son,<br/>He fought with sin and Jesus won,<br/>And now men may be free from sin at last.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Jesus claimed He wasn't good,<br/>He strove against sin unto blood,<br/>And as a man He showed what man could do.<br/>Now He has a name above all names,<br/>And gives us power to do the same,<br/>The overcoming power of Christ in you.</lines>
