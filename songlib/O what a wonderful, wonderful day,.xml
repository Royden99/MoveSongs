    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O what a wonderful, wonderful day,<br/>A day I will never forget,<br/>After I wandered in darkness away<br/>Jesus, my Saviour, I met;<br/>O, what a tender compassionate friend,<br/>He met the need of my heart,<br/>Shadows dispelling, with joy I am telling<br/>He made all the darkness depart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Heaven came down<br/>And glory filled my soul,<br/>When at the cross<br/>My Saviour made me whole,<br/>My sins were washed away<br/>And my night was turned to day,<br/>When heaven came down<br/>And glory filled my soul.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Born of the Spirit with life from above<br/>Into God's family divine,<br/>Justified fully through Calvary's love<br/>Oh what a standing is mine,<br/>And the transaction so quickly was made<br/>When as a sinner I came,<br/>Took of the offer of grace He did proffer<br/>He saved me; oh praise His dear name.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Now I've a hope that will surely endure<br/>After the passing of time,<br/>I have a future in heaven for sure<br/>There in those mansions sublime<br/>And it's because of that wonderful day<br/>When at the cross I believed,<br/>Riches eternal and blessings supernal<br/>From His precious hand I received.<br/></lines>
