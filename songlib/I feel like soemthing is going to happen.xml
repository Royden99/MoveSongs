      <lines>I feel like something good is about to happen;<br/>I just feel like something good is on its way.<br/>He has promised that He would open all of heaven,<br/>And brother, this could be that very day.</lines>

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When God's people humble themselves to call on Jesus<br/>And they look to heaven expecting as they pray<br/>I just feel that something good is about to happen,<br/>And brother, this could be the very day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I have learned in all that happens just to praise Him,<br/>For I know He is working all things for my good.<br/>Every tear I shed is worth all investment,<br/>For I know He'll see me through, He said He would.<br/>He's promised eye nor ear can hardly fathom<br/>All the things that He has in store for those who pray.<br/>I just feel like something good is about to happen,<br/>And brother, this could be the very day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Yes, I have noticed all of the bad news in the paper,<br/>And it seems like things are bleaker every day.<br/>But for this child of God it makes no difference<br/>Because its bound to get better either way.<br/>Well, I have never been so thrilled about tomorrow;<br/>Sunshine is always bursting through the clouds of grace,<br/>I just feel like something good is about to happen,<br/>And brother, this could  be the very day.</lines>
