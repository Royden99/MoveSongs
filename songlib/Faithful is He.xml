    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Faithful is He<br/>Who has started His good work in me.<br/>Every promise He will keep.<br/>Every work He will complete.<br/>Faithful is He.<br/>Faithful is He.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Time after time, we falter,<br/>And time after time, God is there,<br/>Sharing His grace sufficient that we<br/>Over sin might prevail.<br/>And I wonder that He loves us<br/>And still delights in treasures encased<br/>In vessels of clay,<br/>Demonstrating God's unfailing faithfulness.</lines>
