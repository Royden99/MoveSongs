    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Faithful is He, <br/>Who has started his good work <br/>in me,  <br/>every promise He will keep, <br/>every work He will complete, <br/>Faithful is He, Faithful is He.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Time after time we falter <br/>and time after time <br/>God is there for us, <br/>Sharing His grace sufficient <br/>that we over sin might prevail, <br/>and I wonder that He loves us <br/>and still delights <br/>in treasure encased <br/>in vessels of clay. <br/>Demonstrating God's unfailing faithfulness.</lines>
