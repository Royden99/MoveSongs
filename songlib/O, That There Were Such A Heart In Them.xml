    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Oh that there were such a heart in men<br/>That they would fear Me,<br/>And keep all My commandments always;<br/>That it might be well with them<br/>And with their children forever,<br/>Oh that there were such a heart in men!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Ye shall walk in all the ways<br/>That the Lord your God has commanded you,<br/>That ye may live, that it might be well with you;<br/>That it may prolong your days<br/>In the land that ye shall possess,<br/>Oh that there were such a heart in men!<br/></lines>
