    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Strengthen thyselves, oh daughters of Zion,<br/>Put on thy zeal as a garment.<br/>Strengthen thyselves, oh sons of the Most High,<br/>Put on thy zeal as a mantle.<br/>Chorus:<br/>And strengthen thyselves in thy God.<br/>Lift up the hands that are weak.<br/>Strengthen thyselves, <br/>Oh strengthen thyselves in thy God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The Lord thy God does turn kings' hearts unto thee,<br/>To strengthen thy hands - to build up the house.<br/>Just as it was with the prophets of old,<br/>They now speak to the house - to strengthen your hearts.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Wait on the Lord and be of good courage,<br/>And He will strengthen thy heart.<br/>Be of good courage all who hope in the Lord,<br/>And He will strengthen thy heart.</lines>
