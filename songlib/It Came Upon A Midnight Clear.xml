    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>It came upon the midnight clear,<br/>That glorious song of old,<br/>From angels behind near the earth,<br/>To touch their harps of gold:<br/>"Peace on the earth, goodwill to men<br/>From heaven's all-gracious King!"<br/>The world in solemn stillness lay<br/>To hear the angels sing.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Still through the cloven skies they come,<br/>With peaceful wings unfurled,<br/>And still their heavenly music floats<br/>O'er all the weary world;<br/>Above its sad and lonely plains<br/>They bend on heavenly wing,<br/>And ever o'er its Babel sounds<br/>The blessed angels sing.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Yet, with the woes of sin and strife,<br/>The world has suffered long,<br/>Beneath the angels' strain have rolled<br/>two thousand years of wrong;<br/>And man, at war with man, hears not<br/>The love-song which they bring:<br/>O hush the noise, ye men of strife,<br/>And hear the angels sing.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>For lo! the days are hastening on,<br/>By prophet bards foretold<br/>When, with the ever circling years<br/>comes round the age of gold<br/>When peace shall over all the earth<br/>Its ancient splendours fling,<br/>And the whole world send back the song<br/>Which now the angels sing!<br/></lines>
