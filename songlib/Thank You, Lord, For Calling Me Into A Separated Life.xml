    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Thank You, Lord, for calling me into a separated life<br/>A life foreordained to live above all chaos and strife.<br/>A life that is dedicated, and consecrated, too.<br/>Not only separated from, but separated unto You.<br/>Chorus:<br/>So, help me, Lord, to be faithful to my calling,<br/>That in due time I can be known with Your chosen few;<br/>And if I falter, my mind wavers, or my eyes begin to dim,<br/>Let Your faithfulness continue to deal with me, to let You deal within.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Thank You, Lord, for leading me to a walk of obedience;<br/>A walk that chooses God's own will, desiring nothing less<br/>A walk that's pure and holy; travailing in the narrow way<br/>A walk that exercises faith, and waits to listen and see.</lines>
