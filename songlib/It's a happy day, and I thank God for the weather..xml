    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>It's a happy day, and I thank God for the weather.<br/>It's a happy day, and I'm living it for my Lord.<br/>It's a happy day, things are gonna get better,<br/>Living each day by the promises in God's Word.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>It's a grumpy day, and I can't stand the weather.<br/>It's a grumpy day, living it for myself.<br/>It's a grumpy day, and things aren't gonna get better<br/>Living each day with my Bible up on my shelf.<br/></lines>
