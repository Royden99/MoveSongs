    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>Thank God for Jesus.<br/>Thank Him for His grace and power.<br/>In the day of fire,<br/>He's coming forth in man<br/>For all the earth to see in this hour.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Here we stand, bound in golden chains,<br/>Tied to the heart of the Father,<br/>Held by the love that walked up Calvary's hill<br/>To become our Lord and Master.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Tell me the story of Jesus and His love.<br/>Tell me how He rose and He took us all above.<br/>Of His poured out life, our example to be.<br/>That we might share His joy<br/>And set creation free.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>If you think it's evil to serve the Lord,<br/>And to walk in His precepts,<br/>Choose you this day whom you will serve,<br/>And make the choice with your whole heart.</lines>
