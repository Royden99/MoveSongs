    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>These are the days of Elijah,<br/>Declaring the word of the Lord,<br/>And these are the days of Your servant, Moses,<br/>Righteousness being restored.<br/>These are the days of great trials,<br/>Of famine and darkness and sword.<br/>Still we are the voice in the desert crying,<br/>Prepare ye the way of the Lord!<br/>Chorus:<br/>Behold ye, He comes, riding on the clouds,<br/>Shining like the sun, at the trumpet call.<br/>Lift your voice, it's the year of Jubilee;<br/>Out of Zion's hill, salvation comes.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>These are the days of Ezekiel,<br/>The dry bones becoming as flesh.<br/>And these are the days of Your servant, David,<br/>Rebuilding the temple of praise.<br/>And these are the days of the harvest.<br/>The fields are all white in the world.<br/>And we are the laborers that are in Your vineyard,<br/>Declaring the Word of the Lord.</lines>
