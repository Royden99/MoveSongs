    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Many are they that rise up against me,<br/>Many are they that say,<br/>'There is no help for him in God;<br/>There is no help for him in God.'<br/>But Thou, O Lord, art a shield for me<br/>The lifter of my head<br/>I cried to the Lord, and He delivered me<br/>And He sustained me,<br/>I cried to the Lord, and He delivered me<br/>And He sustained me.<br/>Arise, O Lord!  Arise, O Lord,<br/>And save me!<br/></lines>
