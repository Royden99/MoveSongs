    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Lord, I believe, help my unbelief.<br/>	Lord, I receive, help my eyes to see.<br/>	That You have power over death and darkness.<br/>	That You have power over death and darkness.<br/>	Lord, I believe.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The faithless will be true, and the blind shall see.<br/> The dumb shall speak to You, and their song shall say <br/>That You have power over death and darkness<br/>That You have power over death and darkness.<br/>Lord I believe.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The bitter will be clean.  And the lame shall walk.<br/>The hardened heart will bow<br/>And the deaf will hear <br/>That You have power over death and darkness.<br/>That You have power over death and darkness.<br/> Lord I believe.</lines>
