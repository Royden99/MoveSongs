      <lines>You shall go out with joy,<br/>And be led forth with peace,<br/>And the mountains and the hills<br/>shall break forth before you.<br/>There'll be shouts of joy,<br/>And the trees of the field shall clap,<br/>Shall clap their hands.<br/>And the trees of the field shall clap their hands, x3<br/>And you'll go out with joy.<br/></lines>
