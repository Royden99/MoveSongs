      <lines>Thanks be to God,<br/>Who leads us in His triumph!<br/>Thanks be to God,<br/>Who's got the victory.	     (x2)</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>We have overcome the world<br/>By the blood of the Lamb,<br/>And loving not our lives<br/>Even unto death.<br/>The word of our testimony<br/>Tells the world about His love,<br/>As we shout unto the nations,<br/>"He is coming back!<br/>Oh! He is coming back!"</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Through the blood of our Saviour<br/>We are set free from the curse;<br/>Jesus is the one and only<br/>Lasting sacrifice!<br/>He has conquered Satan's power,<br/>No more shall we be ashamed,<br/>Just as He defeated death,<br/>We shall never die,<br/>Oh! We shall never die.<br/></lines>
