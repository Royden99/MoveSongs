    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I need You, Lord, more than yesterday,<br/>I need You, Lord, more than words can say,<br/>I need You, Lord, more than ever before,<br/>I need You, Lord, I need You, Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>More than the air I breathe,<br/>More than the song I sing,<br/>More than the next heartbeat,<br/>More than anything;<br/>And, Lord, as time goes by<br/>I'll be by Your side,<br/>'Cause I never want to go back<br/>To my old life.<br/></lines>
