      <lines>i need you more, more than yesterday<br/>i need you more, more than words can say<br/>i need you more, than ever before <br/>i need you lord, i need you lord</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>more than the air i breathe, more than the song i sing<br/>more than the next heartbeat, more than anything<br/>and lord as this time goes by,<br/> i'll be by your side<br/>cause i never want to go back<br/> to my old life</lines>
