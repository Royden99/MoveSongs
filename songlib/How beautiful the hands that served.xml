    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>How beautiful the hands that served<br/>The wine and the bread and the sons of the earth;<br/>How beautiful the feet that walked<br/>The long dusty roads, and the hill to the cross;<br/>How beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful,<br/>Is the body of Christ.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>How beautiful the heart that bled<br/>That took all my sin and bore it instead;<br/>How beautiful the tender eyes<br/>That choose to forgive and never despise;<br/>How beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful,<br/>Is the body of Christ.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And as He lay down His life,<br/>We offer this sacrifice;<br/>That we will live, just as He died,<br/>Willing to pay the price,<br/>Willing to pay the price.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>How beautiful the radiant bride<br/>Who walks to her Groom with His light in her eyes;<br/>How beautiful when humble hearts give<br/>The fruit of pure lives so that others may live;<br/>How beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful,<br/>Is the body of Christ.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>How beautiful the feet that bring<br/>The sound of good news, the love of the King;<br/>How beautiful the hands that serve<br/>The wine and the bread, and the sons of the earth;<br/>How beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful,<br/>Is the body of Christ<br/></lines>
