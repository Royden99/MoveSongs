    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>My soul magnifies the Lord<br/>And my spirit rejoices in my God<br/>My soul magnifies the Lord<br/>And my spirit doth rejoice in God my Saviour<br/>Come magnify with me<br/>And let us exalt His name together<br/>My help and shield are found in Him<br/>My soul waits for the Lord<br/>My soul waits for the Lord<br/>My soul makes her boast in Thee<br/>The humble shall hear it and be glad<br/>My soul makes her boast in Thee<br/>The humble shall hear and they shall be glad<br/>O taste and see that the Lord is good x3<br/>I called on Him and He answered me<br/>This poor man cried and the Lord heard x3<br/>He delivered me from all my fears<br/></lines>
