    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He lowers us to raise us<br/>So we can sing His praises,<br/>Whatever is His way all is well.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He makes us rich and poor<br/>That we might trust Him more,<br/>Whatever is His way all is well.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>All my changes come from Him, He who never changes,<br/>I'm held firm in the grasp of the Rock of all the ages.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>All is well with my soul,<br/>He is God in control.<br/>I know not all His plans<br/>But I know I'm in His hands.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>He clothes us now then strips us<br/>Yet with His Word equips us,<br/>Whatever is His way, all is well.<br/>And though our seasons change<br/>We still exalt His name,<br/>Whatever is His way all is well.<br/></lines>
