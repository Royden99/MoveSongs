    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>God sent His Son; they called Him Jesus ,<br/>He came to love, heal and forgive,<br/>He lived and died to buy my pardon,<br/>An empty grave is there<br/>To prove my Saviour lives.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Because He lives I can face tomorrow,<br/>Because He lives all fear is gone,<br/>Because I know, I know He holds the future<br/>And life is worth the living<br/>Just because He lives.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>How sweet to hold a newborn baby,<br/>And feel the pride and joy he gives;<br/>But greater still the calm assurance:<br/>This child can face uncertain days<br/>Because He Lives!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>And then one day I'll cross the river,<br/>I'll fight life's final war with pain,<br/>And then as death gives way to vict'ry<br/>I'll see the lights of glory and<br/>I'll know He lives.<br/></lines>
