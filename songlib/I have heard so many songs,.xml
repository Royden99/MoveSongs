    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I have heard so many songs,<br/>Listened to a thousand tongues,<br/>But there is one<br/>That sounds above them all:<br/>The Father's song,<br/>The Father's love,<br/>You sung it over me, and for eternity<br/>It's written on my heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Heaven's perfect melody,<br/>The Creator's symphony,<br/>You are singing over me<br/>The Father's song.<br/>Heaven's perfect mystery,<br/>The King of love has sent for me,<br/>And now You're singing over me<br/>The Father's song.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>(Ending)<br/>The Father's song,<br/>The Father's love,<br/>You sung it over me, and for eternity<br/>It's written on my heart.<br/></lines>
