    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I want to see Israel marching,<br/>I want to hear the trumpet call,<br/>I want to climb Zion's mountain,<br/>I want to see great Babylon fall.<br/>I want to see Jesus reigning<br/>Upon King David's royal throne:<br/>Oh, won't that be a glorious sight to see when<br/>Israel comes marching home!<br/></lines>
