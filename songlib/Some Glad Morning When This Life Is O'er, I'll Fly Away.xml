    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Some glad morning when this life is o'er, I'll fly away.<br/>To a home on God's celestial shore, I'll fly away.<br/>I'll fly away, O glory, I'll fly away.<br/>When I die, Hallelujah! by and by, I'll fly away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When the shadows of this life have gone, I'll fly away <br/>Like a bird from prison bars has flown, I'll fly away.<br/>I'll fly away. O glory, I'll fly away. <br/>When I die, Hallelujah! by and by, I'll fly away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Just a few more weary days ahead. I'll fly away.<br/>To a land where, joy shall never end, I'll fly away.<br/>I'll fly away, O Glory, I'll fly away.<br/>When I die, Hallelujah! by and by, I'll fly away.</lines>
