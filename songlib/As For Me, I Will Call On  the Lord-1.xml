      <lines>As for me, I will call upon the Lord.<br/>I will call upon Thy name.<br/>Early in the morning, I will lift my song to Thee.<br/>For You are my shelter, my helper in all things.<br/>You have delivered me from all my troubles,<br/>And I will praise Your name.<br/>I will sacrifice my life to Thee,<br/>And I will praise Your name.<br/>I will sacrifice my life to Thee.<br/>Oh Lord, You are my strength.</lines>
