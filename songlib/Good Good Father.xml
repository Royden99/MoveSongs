    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Oh, I've heard a thousand stories of what they think you're like<br/>But I've heard the tender whisper of love in the dead of night<br/>And you tell me that you're pleased, And that I'm never alone</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>You're a Good, Good Father<br/>It's who you are, it's who you are, it's who you are<br/>And I'm loved by you<br/>It's who I am, it's who I am, it's who I am<br/>Cause you are perfect in all of your ways<br/>You are perfect in all of your ways<br/>You are perfect in all of your ways to us</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Oh, and I've seen many searching for answers far and wide<br/>But I know we're all searching, For answers only you provide<br/>Cause you know just what we need, Before we say a word</lines>
