    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I've heard a thousand stories of what they think you're like<br/>But I've heard the tender whispers of love in the dead of night<br/>And you tell me that you're pleased<br/>And that I'm never alone</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>You're a good good father<br/>It's who you are, it's who you are, it's who you are<br/>And I'm loved by you<br/>It's who I am, it's who I am, it's who I am</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I've seen many searching for answers far and wide<br/>But I know we're all searching<br/>For answers only you provide<br/>'Cause you know just what we need<br/>Before we say a word</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>You are perfect in all of your ways<br/>You are perfect in all of your ways<br/>You are perfect in all of your ways to us</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Oh, it's love so undeniable<br/>I, I can hardly speak<br/>Peace so unexplainable<br/>I, I can hardly think</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>As you call me deeper still<br/>As you call me deeper still<br/>As you call me deeper still<br/>Into love, love, love<br/></lines>
    </verse>
