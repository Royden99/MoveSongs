    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Light of the world, You step down into darkness.<br/>Opened my eyes let me see.<br/>Beauty that made this heart adore you <br/>hope of a life spent with you.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And here I am to worship, Here I am to bow down,<br/>Here I am to say that you're my God,<br/>You're altogether lovely, Altogether worthy, Altogether wonderful to me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>King of all days, Oh so highly exalted Glorious in heaven above.<br/>Humbly you came to the earth you created.<br/>All for love's sake became poor.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I'll never know how much it cost to see my sin upon that cross (2x)</lines>
