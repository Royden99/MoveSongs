    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When you walk with the Lord, <br/>Each day is one that He has made. <br/>When you walk with Jesus <br/>Life's little pieces fall in place. <br/>And you'll find things working out <br/>You never thought that would, <br/>For all things work together for good <br/>To them who love God, every day <br/>Is one that He has made. </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And if you should ever feel <br/>That the Lord's not real, <br/>And He's a thousand miles away, <br/>Just be assured it's for your own good;<br/>Just trust the Lord and say... (repeat first part)</lines>
