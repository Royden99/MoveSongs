    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I heard ten thousand trumpets Sounding forth His glory.<br/>I heard all heaven's angels lift their song on high.<br/>I heard ten million voices praise the name of Jesus,<br/>Filling all the throne room in the sky.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I heard from every nation a mighty<br/>A mighty swelling chorus<br/>I heard the song of the blood bought of Moses and the Lamb,<br/>I heard the cry of triumph from saints down through the ages,<br/>Filling all the throne room in the sky.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I heard the Lion of Judah.<br/>I heard His voice of thunder.<br/>I heard the mighty waters of God's eternal love.<br/>I heard the overcomers shouting out His glory,<br/>Filling all the throne room in the sky.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I heard God's new creation worship and adore Him.<br/>I heard a pure, sweet language fill all the earth and sky.<br/>I heard God's day of fullness being manifested,<br/>Filling all the throne room in the sky.</lines>
