    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I want to live the way he wants me to live<br/>I want to give until there's just no more to give.<br/>I want to love, love till there's just no more love<br/>I could never, never out-love the Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I found out that giving and loving brought pain<br/>And I promised I would never let it happen again<br/>But I found out that loving was well worth the risk<br/>And that even in losing you win.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>He showed me that only in dying we live<br/>And He gave when it seemed there was nothing to give<br/>He loved when loving brought heartache and loss<br/>He forgave from an old rugged cross.</lines>
    </verse>
