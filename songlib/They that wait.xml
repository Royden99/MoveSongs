    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>They that wait upon the Lord <br/>         Shall renew their strength<br/>          They shall mount up with wings as eagles<br/>          They shall run and not be weary <br/>          They shall walk and not faint<br/>          Teach me Lord, teach me Lord to wait.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Teach me Lord to wait, down on my knees.<br/>'Till in Your own good time <br/>You will answer my plea <br/>Teach me not to rely on what others do<br/> But to wait in prayer for the answer from You</lines>
