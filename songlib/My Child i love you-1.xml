    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I have bought you,<br/>I have called you by name.<br/>I have written My name on your heart,<br/>And engraved yours on Mine.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>My child I love you.<br/>As the sand on the shore,<br/>And the stars in the night sky,<br/>So are My thoughts of you.<br/>I have your good in mind.<br/>My child I love you.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>When you go through the water,<br/>And walk through the flame,<br/>Fear not, your hand is in Mine,<br/>And I will not lead you astray.</lines>
