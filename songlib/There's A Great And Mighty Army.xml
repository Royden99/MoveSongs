    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There's a great and mighty army<br/>In the earth today, dressed in splendid armor,<br/>Preparing for the fray. The hosts of darkness<br/>Tremble as they march away.<br/>There's a great and mighty army<br/>In the earth today.<br/>So let's shout the shout of victory!<br/>The enemy is under our feet.<br/>Let us shout the shout of victory!<br/>For great is our King,<br/>Great is our King, great is our King.</lines>
