    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>No man can sing this song that I sing.<br/>No man can walk this narrow way,<br/>But those in the Christ caught up in glory<br/>The sing this song in a living way.<br/>I'll sing this song through the ages.<br/>I'll walk this way upon the earth,<br/>That those that see will magnify<br/>And those that hear will praise His name.</lines>
