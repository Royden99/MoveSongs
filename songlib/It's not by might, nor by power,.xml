    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>It's not by might, nor by power,<br/>But by My Spirit says the Lord of hosts;<br/>It's not by might, nor by power,<br/>But by My Spirit says the Lord.<br/>This mountain shall be removed,<br/>This mountain shall be removed,<br/>This mountain shall be removed,<br/>By My Spirit says the Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Is there a mountain in your way,<br/>Do doubts and fears alarm?<br/>If so, you'll hear the Spirit say<br/>"This mountain shall come down!"</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Is there a hurdle in your path,<br/>A river deep and wide?<br/>Stand still, the waters will rise up,<br/>You'll reach the other side.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Is there a fiery-furnace trial,<br/>Far more than you can bear?<br/>Behold! the blessed Son of God<br/>Is walking with you there.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Trust the Lord, the mighty God,<br/>He'll speak the winds away;<br/>Yea, though it seems you're in a storm,<br/>For you, He'll make a way.<br/></lines>
