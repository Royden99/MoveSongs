    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Don't give up; you're on the brink of a miracle.<br/>Don't give in; God is still on the throne.<br/>Don't give up; you're on the brink of a miracle.<br/>Don't give in; remember you're not alone.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Are you in a situation that's impossible?<br/>Is there darkness just as far as you can see?<br/>Just hold on a little longer,<br/>Put your trust in Father God,<br/>In the morning you will see the victory!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>For His favour is in life,<br/>Weeping may endure for a night,<br/>But know, always know, our God is in control,<br/>And His joy cometh in the morning.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I've got joy in my soul, for God is in control,<br/>He came through when my heart was in despair;<br/>He is almighty and supreme,<br/>Beyond what I could dream,<br/>He is the God Who always answers prayer.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
