    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>His love has no limit, His grace has no measure,<br/>His power has no boundary known unto men;<br/>For out of His infinite riches in Jesus,<br/>He giveth and giveth and giveth again.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He giveth more grace as our burdens grow greater,<br/>He sendeth more strength as our labors increase;<br/>To added afflictions He addeth His mercy,<br/>To multiplied trials He multiplies peace.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>When we have exhausted our store of endurance,<br/>When our strength has failed ere the day is half done,<br/>When we reach the end of our hoarded resources<br/>Our Fatherâ€™s full giving is only begun.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Fear not that thy need shall exceed His provision,<br/>Our God ever yearns His resources to share;<br/>Lean hard on the arm everlasting, availing;<br/>The Father both thee and thy load will upbear.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
