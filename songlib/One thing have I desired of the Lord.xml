    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>For in the time of trouble<br/>He shall hide me in His pavilion<br/>In the secret of His tabernacle shall He hide me<br/>He shall set me up upon a rock<br/>To behold the beauty of the Lord and to enquire in His temple  <br/>To behold the beauty of the Lord and to enquire in His temple.</lines>
