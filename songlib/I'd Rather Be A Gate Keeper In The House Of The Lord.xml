    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I'd rather be a gate keeper in the house of the Lord,<br/>Than to dwell in the tents of the wicked.<br/>(Repeat.)</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I'd rather be the way, the truth, and the life,<br/>A gate keeper in the house of the Lord.<br/>That all who come to know me,<br/>Might also know the Father,<br/>And come into the house of the Lord.</lines>
