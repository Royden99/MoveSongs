    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>You are not alone if you are lonely<br/>When you're feeling afraid you're not the only<br/>We are all the same in need of mercy<br/>To be forgiven and be free<br/>It's all you got to lean on<br/>But thank God it's all you need</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>(Chorus)<br/>And all the people said Amen<br/>And all the people said Amen<br/>Give thanks to the Lord for his love never ends<br/>And all the people said Amen</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>(Verse)<br/>If you're rich or poor well it don't matter<br/>Weak or Strong, you know love is what we're after<br/>We're all broken but we're all in this together<br/>God knows we stumble and we fall<br/>And he so loved the world he sent his son to save us all</lines>

    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>(Bridge)<br/>Blessed are the poor in spirit who are torn apart;<br/>Blessed are the persecuted and the pure in heart;<br/>Blessed are the people hungry for another start,<br/>for this is the kingdom, the kingdom of God</lines>
