    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Jesus said, Come unto Me<br/>Ye that labor and are heavy-laden,<br/>And I will give you rest,<br/>And ye shall find rest unto your souls.<br/>Take My yoke upon you and learn of Me,<br/>For I am lowly in heart.<br/>For My yoke is easy,<br/>And My burden is light.<br/>And ye shall find rest unto your souls.</lines>
