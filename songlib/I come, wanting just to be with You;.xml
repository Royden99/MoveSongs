    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Don't ever let my heart grow cold,<br/>Don't ever let me lose sight of Your truth.<br/>Draw near that I may drink from eternal water.</lines>

    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>You are the Fountain of all life,<br/>You are the peace unto my soul.<br/>You are the Way, the Truth, the Light;<br/>Jesus, into Your arms I run.<br/>You are the Holy Son of God,<br/>You gave up Your life to save my soul.<br/>You have redeemed me through the cross;<br/>Jesus, with thankfulness I come.<br/></lines>
