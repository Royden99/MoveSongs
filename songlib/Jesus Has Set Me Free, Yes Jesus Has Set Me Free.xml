    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Jesus has set me free, yes Jesus has set me free.<br/>Now, I am free indeed.<br/>The Holy Spirit came my way.<br/>Now, I'm shouting night and day.<br/>I'm free from condemnation and sin.<br/>And when the devil then said No,<br/>Then I just tell him where to go.<br/>There's no way that he can win.<br/>So glory, Hallelujah, praise His name forever.<br/>I've come away from where I've been.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>So come along and sing this song.<br/>And you can join this happy throng<br/>That's going to the promised Land.<br/>Jesus is the Pattern Son.<br/>The victory's already won.<br/>So come on up and take your land.</lines>
