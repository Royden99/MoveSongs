      <lines>I'm beholding the face of my Master.<br/>In the life of my brother I see<br/>Him coming in glory with angels<br/>To fulfill His appearing in me.<br/>I know not what I shall be like,<br/>Nor what body is given to me.<br/>But, when He shall appear I'll be like Him,<br/>And He shall be glorified in me.</lines>
