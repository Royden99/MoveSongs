    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Ye Are a Chosen Generation,<br/>A holy nation, a priesthood of the royal line;<br/>That you should show forth the praise<br/>Of Him Who raised us into His marvelous light.<br/>Which in time past were not a people,<br/>But are now the people of God;<br/>But are now, now, now the people of God.</lines>
