    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We have laboured in the vineyard from<br/>dawn to setting sun,<br/>Counting me forever ready until our Lord<br/>shall come.<br/>When our work on earth is over and<br/>every knee shall bow,<br/>I want to be found ready with my hand<br/>upon the plough.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Keep your hand on the gospel plough.<br/>Heaven's shining goal is waiting now.<br/>Keep pressing on; don't look back now.<br/>Keep your hand on the gospel plough.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>We plough the fields with patience waitin'<br/>for the harvest time.<br/>Sowin' seeds of salvation until the<br/>laying by.<br/>Looking forward to the reaping we must<br/>be steadfast somehow.<br/>With our eyes upon the Master and our<br/>hands upon the plough.<br/></lines>
