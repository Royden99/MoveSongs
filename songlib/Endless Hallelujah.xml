    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When I stand before Your throne<br/>Dressed in glory not my own<br/>What a joy I'll sing of on that day<br/>No more tears or broken dreams<br/>Forgotten is the minor key<br/>Everything as it was meant to be</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And we will worship, worship<br/>Forever in Your presence we will sing<br/>We will worship, worship You<br/>An endless hallelujah to the King</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I will see You as You are<br/>Love You with unsinning heart<br/>And see how much You paid to bring me home<br/>Not till then, Lord, shall I know<br/>Not till then, how much I owe<br/>Everything I am before Your throne</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>No more tears, no more shame<br/>No more sin and sorrow ever known again<br/>No more fears, no more pain<br/>We will see You face to face<br/>See You face to face</lines>
    </verse>
