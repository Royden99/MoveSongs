    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Praise, my soul, the King of heaven;<br/>To His feet thy tribute bring;<br/>Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,<br/>Who like thee His praise should sing?<br/>Praise Him!  Praise Him! (x2)<br/>Praise the everlasting King.<br/>Praise Him for His grace and favour<br/>To our fathers in distress;<br/>Praise Him, still the same for ever,<br/>Slow to chide and swift to bless.<br/>Praise Him! Praise Him! (x2)<br/>Glorious in His faithfulness.<br/>Father-like He tends and spares us,<br/>Well our feeble frame He knows;<br/>In His hands He gently bears us,<br/>Rescues us from all our foes:<br/>Praise Him!  Praise Him! (x2)<br/>Widely as His mercy flows.<br/>Angels, help us to adore Him!<br/>Ye behold Him face to face;<br/>Sun and moon, bow down before Him,<br/>Dwellers all in time and space.<br/>Praise Him!  Praise Him! (x2)<br/>Praise with us the God of grace.<br/></lines>
