    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Look around you and see what God has done,<br/>Glowing faces, brand new lives;<br/>The impossible made possible,<br/>Sick and broken made whole,<br/>We're a blessed people of the Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>We are conquerors, we're overcomers,<br/>We have power, God's power in our lives.<br/>We have new hope, we have a joy within,<br/>We are precious in God's sight!<br/></lines>
