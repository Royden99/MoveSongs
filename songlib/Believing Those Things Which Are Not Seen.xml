    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Believing those things which are not seen,<br/>Let us boldly enter in.<br/>Not by the eye, nor by the ear,<br/>But by the Word of Truth I've given.<br/>Chorus:<br/>Walk boldly believing this,<br/>If ye be otherwise,<br/>I shall reveal it unto thee.<br/>Believing those things which are not seen,<br/>Enter in.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Ye are the Lily of the valley,<br/>Being clothed without hands.<br/>Ye are the trees, plantings of the Lord,<br/>Against whom no enemy shall stand.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Ye are holy, without blame<br/>Before me in love.<br/>Called by me, to my glory,<br/>I descend like a dove.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Ye are the temple of the Lord,<br/>Now I have a dwelling place.<br/>I am Thy Life, ye are my glory.<br/>Ye shall see me face to face.</lines>
