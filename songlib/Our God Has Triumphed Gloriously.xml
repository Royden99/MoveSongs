      <lines>I will sing unto the Lord<br/>For He has triumphed gloriously,<br/>The horse and rider thrown into the sea!<br/>I will sing unto the Lord<br/>For He has triumphed gloriously,<br/>The grave is empty won't you come and see!<br/>The Lord, my God, my Strength, my Song,<br/>Now He is my Victory!<br/>The Lord, my God, my Strength, my Song,<br/>Now He is my Victory!<br/>The Lord is God and I will praise Him,<br/>My Father's God and I will exalt Him,<br/>The Lord is God and I will praise Him,<br/>My Father's God and I will exalt Him!<br/></lines>
