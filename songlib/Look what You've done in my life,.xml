      <lines>And though I'm not deserving of Your love<br/>You give it all to me<br/>With open arms You welcome me.</lines>

    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Your love is higher than the mountains,<br/>Your love, deeper than the sea;<br/>Jesus, You came to pay my ransom;<br/>It's Your love, Jesus, that sets me free.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Sets me free, sets me free, sets me free<br/>It's Your love that sets me free.<br/></lines>
