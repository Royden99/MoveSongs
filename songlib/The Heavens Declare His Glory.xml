    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The heavens declare His glory<br/>The earth, the work of His hands.<br/>Man, the image of His glory,<br/>Jesus Christ, the head of this man.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Jesus, the endless Spirit,<br/>Reproducing Himself in all,<br/>Destroying the old creation,<br/>Of the twain making one new man.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>He was sown in the midst of confusion;<br/>But in glory He is coming again.<br/>He was sown in the midst of corruption;<br/>But in power He is coming today.</lines>
