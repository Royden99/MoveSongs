    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Jesus is seated here,<br/>Waiting for His bride to come in<br/>Clothed in His righteousness,<br/>Being made free from their sin,<br/>So come into His chamber<br/>And shut the door round about.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>O Lord, I want to feel Your presence,<br/>I want to know who You are<br/>And, O Lord, I want to see Your fullness,<br/>Reveal Who You are.<br/></lines>
