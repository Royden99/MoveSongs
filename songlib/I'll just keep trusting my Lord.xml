    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I'll just keep trusting my Lord as I walk along<br/>	I'll just keep trusting my Lord and He gives a song<br/>	Tho' storm–clouds darken the sky o'er the heavenly trail<br/>	I'll just keep trusting my Lord, He will never fail<br/>	He's a faithful friend, such a faithful friend<br/>	You can count on Him to the very end<br/>	Tho' storm–clouds darken the sky o'er the heavenly trail<br/>	I'll just keep trusting my Lord, He will never fail</lines>
