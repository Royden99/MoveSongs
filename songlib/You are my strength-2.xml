    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>You are my strength when I am weak, <br/>You are the treasure that I seek, <br/>You are my all in all. <br/>Seeking You as a precious jewel, <br/>Lord to give up I'd be a fool, <br/>You are my all in all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Jesus Lamb of God, <br/>Worthy is Your name (2x) </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>You've taken my sin my guilt my shame, <br/>Rising again I'll bless Your name, <br/>You are my all in all. <br/>When I fall down You pick me up, <br/>When I am dry You fill my cup, <br/>You are my all in all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I was in chains and now walk free,<br/>Nothing to give, yet You loved me,<br/>Thought of me above all.<br/>You made me to be set apart,<br/>Work within me Your perfect heart,<br/>Till You are all in all.</lines>
