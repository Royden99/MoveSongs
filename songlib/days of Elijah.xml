    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>These are the days of Elijah<br/>Declaring the word of the Lord<br/>And these are the days of your servant Moses<br/>Righteousness being restored<br/>And though these are days of great trials<br/>of famine and darkness and sword<br/>still we are the voice in the desert crying <br/>prepare ye the way of the Lord</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Behold He comes<br/>Riding on the clouds<br/>shining like the sun<br/>at the trumpet call<br/>Lift your voice<br/>It's the year of Jubilee<br/>Out of Zion's hill salvation comes</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>These are the days of Ezekiel <br/>The dry bones becoming as flesh<br/>And these are the days of your servant, David <br/>rebuilding the temple of praise<br/>and these are the days of the harvest  <br/>the fields are as white in your world<br/>and we are the laborers in your vineyard<br/>declaring the word of the Lord</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>There's no God like Jehovah (8x's)</lines>
