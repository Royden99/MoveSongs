    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>The race is not to the swift,<br/>Nor the battle to the strong,<br/>But to him that endures to the end,<br/>So endure to the end my son.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Little children, your sins are forgiven,<br/>And you have been born again.<br/>But remember, this is just the beginning.<br/>Will you be there at the end?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Young men, you have overcome,<br/>And in you abides His word.<br/>But remember, there are much stronger ones,<br/>And you will need the strength of the Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Fathers, you have known Him who is<br/>The Beginning; the Father you've known.<br/>But remember, there is no rest in this,<br/>Not till you enter your heavenly home.</lines>
