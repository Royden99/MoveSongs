      <lines>This is holy ground.<br/>We're standing on holy ground. <br/>For the Lord is present, and where He is, is holy.<br/>       - Repeat-<br/>These are holy lips. We're singing through holy lips.<br/>For the Lord is singing<br/>Through these and they are holy.<br/>        - Repeat -–<br/>These are holy hands. We're lifting up holy hands.<br/>For the Lord is working<br/>Through these and they are holy.<br/>Repeat –</lines>
