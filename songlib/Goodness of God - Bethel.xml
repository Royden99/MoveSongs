    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I love You Lord - Oh Your mercy never fails me<br/>All my days - I’ve been held in Your hands<br/>From the moment that I wake up - Until I lay my head<br/>I will sing of the goodness of God</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>All my life You have been faithful<br/>All my life You have been so, so good<br/>With every breath that I am able<br/>I will sing of the goodness of God</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I love Your voice - You have led me through the fire<br/>In darkest nights - You are close like no other<br/>I’ve known You as a father - I’ve known You as a friend<br/>I have lived in the goodness of God</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Your goodness is running after, it’s running after me<br/>Your goodness is running after, it’s running after me<br/>With my life laid down, I’m surrendered now, I give You everything<br/>Your goodness is running after, it’s running after me</lines>
    </verse>
