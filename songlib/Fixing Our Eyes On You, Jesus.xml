    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Fixing our eyes on You, Jesus,<br/>The Author and the Finisher of faith,<br/>Who for the joy set before You<br/>Endured the cross, despised the shame,<br/>And is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.<br/>Chorus:<br/>He who overcomes will I grant to sit down<br/>With Me upon My throne<br/>As I indeed overcame and sat down<br/>With my Father upon His throne.<br/>To the only wise God and Savior<br/>Be glory and majesty, dominion and power,<br/>Both now and forevermore.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Fixing our eyes on You, Jesus,<br/>The Author and the Finisher of faith,<br/>For You shall lead us to glory<br/>All those who take up their cross<br/>Which to us who are now being saved<br/>Is the power of God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Fixing our eyes on You, Jesus,<br/>The Author and the Finisher of faith,<br/>For we see that we are encompassed<br/>By so great a cloud of witnesses<br/>Who were slain for the Word of their God<br/>For the truth to which they did hold.</lines>
