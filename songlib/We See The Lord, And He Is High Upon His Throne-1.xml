      <lines>We see the Lord, and He is high upon His throne,<br/>And His glory fills the heavens and the earth.<br/>One like the Lamb who was slain is on the throne,<br/>And we cast our crowns before Him and bow down to pray.</lines>

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Everything cries holy, (3x.)<br/>To You, Lord. (2x.)</lines>
