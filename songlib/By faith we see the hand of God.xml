    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>By faith we see the hand of God<br/>In the light of creation's grand design<br/>In the lives of those who prove His faithfulness<br/>Who walk by faith and not by sight<br/>By faith our fathers roamed the earth<br/>With the power of His promise in their hearts<br/>Of a holy city built by God's own hand<br/>A place where peace and justice reign<br/>We will stand as children of the promise<br/>We will fix our eyes on Him our soul's reward<br/>Till the race is finished and the work is done<br/>We'll walk by faith and not by sight<br/>By faith the prophets saw a day<br/>When the longed-for Messiah would appear<br/>With the power to break the chains of sin and death<br/>And rise triumphant from the grave<br/>By faith the church was called to go<br/>In the power of the Spirit to the lost<br/>To deliver captives and to preach good news<br/>In every corner of the earth<br/>We will stand as children of the promise<br/>We will fix our eyes on Him our soul's reward<br/>Till the race is finished and the work is done<br/>We'll walk by faith and not by sight<br/>By faith this mountain shall be moved<br/>And the power of the gospel shall prevail<br/>For we know in Christ all things are possible<br/>For all who call upon His name<br/>We will stand as children of the promise<br/>We will fix our eyes on Him our soul's reward<br/>Till the race is finished and the work<br/></lines>
