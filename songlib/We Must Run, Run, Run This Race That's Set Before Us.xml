    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We must run, run, run<br/>The race that's set before us,<br/>We must run, run, run<br/>Until the race is won,<br/>Let us lay aside each weight<br/>And the sin that doth beset us<br/>And we'll run, run, run<br/>Until the race is won.</lines>

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Jesus ran, ran, ran<br/>The race that was before Him<br/>And He won, won, won,<br/>He is now at God's right hand<br/>And together with the cloud<br/>Of witnesses He's calling us<br/>To run, run, run<br/>Until the race is won.<br/></lines>
