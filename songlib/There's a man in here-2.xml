    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There's a man in here who turns water to wine<br/>And he walks on the water and gives sight to the blind <br/>And he gives back life to the one that's dead<br/>He fed four thousand with seven loaves of bread<br/>Yes, there's a man in here who makes demons flee<br/>He makes cripples to walk and He's chooses even me<br/>And He lives in my heart and I'll have no fear<br/>I'm a better man 'cause there's a man in here.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>There's a man in here that I'm looking for<br/>Cried the man who could find no room at the door<br/>So they lowered him down on a stretcher-bed<br/>And Jesus looked at him and said<br/>All your sins are now all gone this day<br/>Take up your bed and go your way<br/>As he walked through the crowd you could hear Him declare<br/>I can tell you all that there's a man in there.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There's a man in here, the disciples cried<br/>As the ship was tossed from side to side<br/>So they woke Him up as the waves grew high<br/>And said, Don't you care that we're about to die?<br/>And he said, Peace! Be still! And when the winds had laid<br/>He said, Where's your faith why were you so afraid?<br/>When they saw that the waves were smooth and clear<br/>They said, Thank you, God, that there's a man in here!</lines>
