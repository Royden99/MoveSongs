    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I was sure by now,<br/>God You would have reached down.<br/>And wiped our tears away,<br/>Stepped in and saved the day.<br/>But once again.<br/>I'll say amen.<br/>And it's still raining.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>And as the thunder rolls,<br/>I barely here Your whisper through the rain.<br/>As your mercy falls, I'll raise my hands,<br/>And praise the God who gives and takes away.<br/>And I'll praise You in this storm,<br/>And I will lift my hands.<br/>For You are who You are,<br/>No matter where I am;<br/>And every tear I've cried<br/>You hold in your hand.<br/>You never left my side,<br/>And though my heart is torn,<br/>I will praise You in this storm.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I remember when I stumbled in the wind.<br/>You heard my cry to You and raised me up again.<br/>My strength is almost gone.<br/>How can I carry on<br/>If I can't find You?</lines>
