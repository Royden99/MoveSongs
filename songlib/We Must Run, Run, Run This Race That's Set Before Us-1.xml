    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We must run, run, run this race that's set before us<br/>We must run, run, run until the race is won.<br/>Let us lay aside each weight and the sin that doth<br/>Beset us and we'll run, run, run until the race is won.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Jesus ran, ran, ran this race that's set before us,<br/>And He won, won, won; He is now at God's right hand.<br/>Together with the cloud of witnesses<br/>He's calling us to run, run, run until the race is won.</lines>
