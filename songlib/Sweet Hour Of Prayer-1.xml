    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!<br/>That calls me from a world of care,<br/>And bids me at my Father’s throne<br/>Make all my wants and wishes known.<br/>In seasons of distress and grief,<br/>My soul has often found relief,<br/>And oft escaped the tempter’s snare,<br/>By thy return, sweet hour of prayer!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!<br/>The joys I feel, the bliss I share,<br/>Of those whose anxious spirits burn<br/>With strong desires for thy return!<br/>With such I hasten to the place<br/>Where God my Savior shows His face,<br/>And gladly take my station there,<br/>And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!<br/>Thy wings shall my petition bear<br/>To Him whose truth and faithfulness<br/>Engage the waiting soul to bless.<br/>And since He bids me seek His face,<br/>Believe His Word and trust His grace,<br/>I’ll cast on Him my every care,<br/>And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer!</lines>
