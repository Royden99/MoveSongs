    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Take us to the river,<br/>Take us there in unity to sing<br/>A song of Your salvation<br/>To win this generation for our King,<br/>A song of Your forgiveness,<br/>For it is with grace that river flows,<br/>Take us to the river in the city of our God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Take us to Your throne room,<br/>Give us ears to hear the cry of heaven,<br/>For that cry is mercy,<br/>Mercy to the fallen sons of men;<br/>Mercy, it has triumphed,<br/>Triumphed over judgement by Your blood,<br/>Take us to the throne room in the city of our God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>For the Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is upon us,<br/>This is the year of the Lord,<br/>The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is upon us,<br/>This is the year of the Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Take us to the mountain,<br/>Lift us in the shadow of Your hand<br/>As this Your mighty angel<br/>Stands astride the ocean and the land,<br/>In His hand Your mercy showers<br/>On a dry and barren place,<br/>Take us to the mountain in the city of our God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>For the Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is upon us,<br/>This is the year of the Lord,<br/>The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is upon us,<br/>This is the year of the Lord.<br/>(Last time)<br/>Take us to the river in the city of our God.<br/></lines>
