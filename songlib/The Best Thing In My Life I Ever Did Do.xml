      <lines>The best thing in my life I ever did do,<br/>The best thing in my life I ever did do,<br/>The best thing in my life I ever did do<br/>Was to take off the old robe<br/>And put on the new.</lines>

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>O, the old robe was wrinkled<br/>And tattered and torn.<br/>The new robe was spotless,<br/>Had never been worn.<br/>O the best thing in my life I ever did do<br/>Was to take off the old robe<br/>And put on the new.</lines>
