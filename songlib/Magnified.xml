    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I have made You too small in my eyes.<br/>O Lord, forgive me;<br/>I have believed in a lie<br/>That You were unable to help me.<br/>But now, O Lord, I see my wrong.<br/>Heal my heart and show Yourself strong;<br/>And in my eyes and with my song,<br/>O Lord, be magnified.<br/>O Lord, be magnified.<br/>Chorus:<br/>Be magnified, O Lord.<br/>You are highly exalted;<br/>And there is nothing You can't do.<br/>O Lord, my eyes are on You.<br/>Be magnified.<br/>O Lord, be magnified.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I have leaned on the wisdom of men.<br/>O Lord, forgive me;<br/>And I have responded to them<br/>Instead of Your light and Your mercy.<br/>But now, O Lord, I see my wrong.<br/>Heal my heart and show Yourself strong;<br/>And in my eyes with my song,<br/>O Lord, be magnified.<br/>O Lord, be magnified.</lines>
