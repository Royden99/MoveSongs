    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I keep coming back to the well of grace,<br/>Great is its power and sweet is the taste,<br/>Whatever temptations and trials I face,<br/>I keep coming back to the well.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Blessed is the fountain in a barren land,<br/>Satisfies the thirst of the inner man,<br/>No better place could be found to dwell,<br/>I thank God for the well.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Jesus made a well at Calvary,<br/>For healing, cleansing, and victory,<br/>My joy overflows, no tongue can tell,<br/>Oh, won't you come to the well?<br/></lines>
    </verse>
