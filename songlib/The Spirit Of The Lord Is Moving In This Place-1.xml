    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The Spirit of the Lord is moving in this place;<br/>He is touching every heart and shining on each face;<br/>He is setting captives free, making blinded eyes to see,<br/>And I know He is blessing me,<br/>For the Spirit of the Lord is moving in this place.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Now the lame are a-walkin' and the dump are a-talkin'<br/>Of God's love that flows so free.<br/>And the hills are a-ringin', and the stones are a-singin',<br/>All creation praises The.<br/>Hear the angels shout, Glory! as they tell the wondrous story,<br/>How He gave His life for me.<br/>Now there's no sin a-hidin', 'cause I'm in the vine abidin'.<br/>Jesus gives the victory.</lines>
