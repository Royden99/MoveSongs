    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He made streams in the desert,<br/>A way in the wilderness,<br/>The waters He parted<br/>And there was dry land,<br/>He made streams in the desert,<br/>A way in the wilderness<br/>Because I held to His hand.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>There were times I know it<br/>My feet were nigh slipping,<br/>And only by grace did I stand;<br/>And the load I carried,<br/>I knelt down below it<br/>But I did not let go of His hand.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And the tempter, untiring,<br/>Drew grand conclusions<br/>Of what a poor fool I am;<br/>And through waves of worry<br/>And clouds of confusion<br/>Still I did not let go of His hand.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>And so, my brethren,<br/>Commit to His keeping<br/>Your lives for Him to plan;<br/>For though trials be grievous<br/>There's no shame in weeping,<br/>Just don't let go of His hand.<br/></lines>
