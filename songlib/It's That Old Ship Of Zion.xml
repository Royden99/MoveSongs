    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>It's that old ship of Zion;<br/>It's that hope of the lost and dying.<br/>It's that soul-saving station;<br/>A mighty tower of salvation.<br/>It's that church triumphant, O yes.<br/>And it's built by the hand of the Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>It's that church in the book of Revelation;<br/>It's built on a Rock, on a firm foundation.<br/>It's been through the storm,<br/>And the storm couldn't turn it.<br/>It's been through the fire,<br/>And the fire couldn't burn it.<br/>It was fed to the lions,<br/>But the lions couldn't eat it.<br/>It's fought a lot of wars,<br/>But it's never been defeated.<br/>It's that church triumphant, O yes!<br/>And it's built by the hand of the Lord.</lines>
