    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Lord, when I think of You<br/>And what I put You through,<br/>I'll never understand Your endless mercy;<br/>To think you chose to come,<br/>Embodied in Your son,<br/>To fall into the hands of Your created.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>O feel my heart explode with praise!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I give You all my love,<br/>I give You everything;<br/>You are the God of heaven<br/>And head over heels with me!<br/>I know You burn with passion<br/>When I call on Your name;<br/>Your love runs as a river<br/>Washing my shame away,<br/>Restoring my faith again, yeah!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>How did You look upon<br/>The sight of Your own blood?<br/>You even took the sin of those who nailed You!<br/>For grace and justice meet<br/>In Him who's chosen me<br/>To walk a path that takes me on to heaven.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
