    <verse name="v1a">
      <lines>[Verse 1]<br/>Through the eyes of men it seems there's so much we have lost<br/>As we look down the road where all the prodigals have walked<br/>One by one the enemy has whispered lies and led them off as slaves</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines><br/>[Verse 2]<br/>But we know that You are God, Yours is the victory<br/>We know there is more to come that we may not yet see<br/>So with the faith You've given us, we step into the valley unafraid, yeah</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines><br/>[Chorus]<br/>As we call out to dry bones, "Come alive, come alive"<br/>We call out to dead hearts, "Come alive, come alive"<br/>Up out of the ashes, let us see an army rise<br/>We call out to dry bones, "Come alive"</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines><br/>[Verse 3]<br/>God of endless mercy, God of unrelenting love<br/>Rescue every daughter, bring us back the wayward sons<br/>And by Your spirit breathe upon them<br/>Show the world that You alone can save<br/>You alone can save</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>[Bridge]<br/>So breathe, oh breath of God<br/>Now breathe, oh breath of God<br/>Breathe, oh breath of God<br/>Now breathe<br/>Breathe, oh breath of God<br/>Now breathe, oh breath of God<br/>Breathe, oh breath of God<br/>Now breathe</lines>
