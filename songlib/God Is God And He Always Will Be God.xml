      <lines>God is God and He always will be God.<br/>God is god and He always will be God. <br/>He's God when the lightning flashes.<br/>He's God when the thunder rolls. <br/>He's God way up in heaven, <br/>And He's God down in my soul.</lines>

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>God is God and He always will be God.<br/>God is God and He always will be God.<br/>He's God in the fiery furnace.<br/>He's God in the lion's den.<br/>He's God of all creation,<br/>And He's God in the hearts of men.</lines>
