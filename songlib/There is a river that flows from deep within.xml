    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There is a river that flows from deep within<br/>     There is a fountain that frees us all from sin<br/>        Come to the waters, there is a vast supply <br/>        Come to the river that never shall run dry.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Tender words I speak to my brother<br/>Tender words he speaks to me<br/>Tender words make all the difference<br/>Even though we may disagree.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And the words I speak, they are spirit <br/> They are spirit and they are life <br/> And those tender words to each other<br/>          Chase away all division and strife.</lines>
