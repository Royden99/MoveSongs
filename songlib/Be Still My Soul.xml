    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Be still, my soul: the Lord is on thy side.<br/>Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain.<br/>Leave to thy God to order and provide;<br/>In every change, He faithful will remain.<br/>Be still, my soul: thy best, thy heav’nly Friend<br/>Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Be still, my soul: thy God doth undertake<br/>To guide the future, as He has the past.<br/>Thy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake;<br/>All now mysterious shall be bright at last.<br/>Be still, my soul: the waves and winds still know<br/>His voice Who ruled them while He dwelt below.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Be still, my soul: when dearest friends depart,<br/>And all is darkened in the vale of tears,<br/>Then shalt thou better know His love, His heart,<br/>Who comes to soothe thy sorrow and thy fears.<br/>Be still, my soul: thy Jesus can repay<br/>From His own fullness all He takes away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Be still, my soul: the hour is hast’ning on<br/>When we shall be forever with the Lord.<br/>When disappointment, grief, and fear are gone,<br/>Sorrow forgot, love’s purest joys restored.<br/>Be still, my soul: when change and tears are past<br/>All safe and blessed we shall meet at last.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Be still, my soul: begin the song of praise<br/>On earth, believing, to Thy Lord on high;<br/>Acknowledge Him in all thy words and ways,<br/>So shall He view thee with a well-pleased eye.<br/>Be still, my soul: the Sun of life divine<br/>Through passing clouds shall but more brightly shine.</lines>
