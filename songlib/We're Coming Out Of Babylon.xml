      <lines>We're coming out of Babylon.<br/>We're coming out of Babylon.<br/>With a song of praise in our hearts to the Lord to sing <br/>We've taken our harps down from the willow tree<br/>For the Lord our God has set us free<br/>We're going to sing and shout the victory.<br/>We're going to magnif the Lord.</lines>
