    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In the heat of the battle, when you're tired and worn.<br/>Seems like you've been defeated; wounded, battered and torn.<br/>In the midst of confusion; in the midst of despair.<br/>When all hope you are losing, remember God is there.<br/>The Lord is always there!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He's always there, He's always there to uphold you.<br/>To heal the pain, bring hope again, to your soul.<br/>Lord of Lords, King of Kings. He'll bear you up on eagles' wings.<br/>He's always there, He's always there, you know.<br/>So in the heat of the battle, don't let go!</lines>
