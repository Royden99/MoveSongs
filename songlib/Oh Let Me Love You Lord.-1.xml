    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Blessed amazing grace<br/>Saved by His sacrifice<br/>He purchased for me a place<br/>And a name in the book of life.<br/>Pure and unchanging love<br/>That rescued my wretched soul;<br/>He gave me new life from above<br/>And He touched me and made me whole.<br/>Oh let me love You, Lord,<br/>The way that You love me<br/>With all that I am, all that I can<br/>And all I will ever be.<br/>Now and forever, now and for always,<br/>Let all that I do bring glory to You,<br/>Honour and praise.<br/>Mercy that lifted me up<br/>To a life lived within the veil<br/>Where He gave me to drink from a cup<br/>Drawn from a living well.<br/>Robes that have been made white<br/>And a joy that's unspeakable;<br/>He's taken my widow's mite<br/>And returned twelve baskets full.<br/></lines>
