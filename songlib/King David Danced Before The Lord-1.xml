    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>King David danced before the Lord.<br/>King David danced before the Lord.<br/>King David danced before the Lord.<br/>On his kinfolks it was hard<br/>For all our sins are taken away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The praisers go before the sword. (3x)<br/>For the battle is the Lord's,<br/>And all my sins are taken away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The ark is coming down the road. (3x)<br/>Coming back to its abode,<br/>And all my sins are taken away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Now all my sins are taken away. (3x)<br/>And I'm rejoicing night and day<br/>For all my sins are taken away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>I'm not going to listen to any more lies. (3x)<br/>There's no room for compromise<br/>For all my sins are taken away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>There's only room for the Word of the Lord. (3x)<br/>And the cutting away of the sword,<br/>For all my sins are taken away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>And now I walk in liberty. (3x)<br/>For the devil has no hold on me,<br/>All my sins are taken away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>And now I walk to set others free. (3x)<br/>For my Lord has delivered me,<br/>And all our sins are taken away.</lines>
