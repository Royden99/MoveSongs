    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Take me through another trial. In the end I know I'll smile.<br/>It's for this thing that I long, to be rid of all my wrong.<br/>As I learn to cease from sin my Lord says I am coming in.<br/>I'm gonna change you and make you just like me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The Lord is teaching me to walk in the Spirit.<br/>He has given me His mind that I might see.<br/>And although the path seems dark I can continue.<br/>I just walk upon the words He speaks to me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I have seen a lot of Christians who won't follow,<br/>The precious words my Savior speaks to me.<br/>They would rather walk along an easy pathway.<br/>As for me, I'll surely take that higher way.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>The Lord is taking us through a lot of suffering.<br/>But it's necessary, you see, to reign with Him.<br/>As He lifts us up and shows us what He's doing.<br/>His face gets brighter and this world gets mighty dim.</lines>
