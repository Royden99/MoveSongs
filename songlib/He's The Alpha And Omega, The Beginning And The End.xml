      <lines>He's the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End,<br/>And somewhere in between, we just get lost.<br/>And somewhere in between, we just get lost.<br/>He's making known unto us the mystery of His will.<br/>He's making known the mystery of life.<br/>He's making us to be the very praise of His glory,<br/>And somewhere in between, we just get lost.</lines>
