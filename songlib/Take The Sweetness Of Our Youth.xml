    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Take the sweetness of our youth,<br/>Blessed Lord we pray, help our lips<br/>To speak no evil, only what You say!<br/>Chorus:<br/>Let us consecrate our lives wholly unto You.<br/>Take the sweetness of our youth, Lord we give to You.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Never let us hate our brother, let us only love.<br/>Let the things we do and say, come from God above.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There are so many ways we could go, it's hard<br/>To know the one, we only want to choose that way<br/>That leads us to Your Son.</lines>
