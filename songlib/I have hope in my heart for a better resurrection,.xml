    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I have hope in my heart for a better resurrection,<br/>I have faith for that final victory;<br/>I believe that, with God, all things are possible,<br/>All things are possible for me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>For I've seen mountains removed and cast into the sea,<br/>I've seen faith like a mustard seed defeat the enemy,<br/>I've cried unto God, for I've seen God deliver,<br/>I have hope, for I see victory.<br/></lines>
