    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>A King met a beggar on a lonely road one day <br/>A strange occurance took place as you will see <br/>The beggar fell upon his knees and cried "Oh pardon me <br/>I am unworthy in Thy presence to be" <br/>Then the king looked at the beggar, <br/>And He said, You've been set free, <br/>Your sins are all forgiven, now You're born in royalty. <br/>Then the King and the beggar walked on arm in arm, you see, <br/>That King was Jesus, and the beggar was me." <br/>He who was rich became so poor that a beggar rich might be <br/>The Son of God became the son of man <br/>That people called the the sons of man the sons of God might be <br/>I can't explain it, God's wonderous saving plan <br/></lines>
