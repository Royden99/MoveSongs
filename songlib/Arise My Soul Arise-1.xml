    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Arise, my soul, arise; shake off thy guilty fears;<br/>The bleeding Sacrifice in my behalf appears:<br/>Before the throne my surety stands,<br/>Before the throne my surety stands,<br/>My name is written on His hands.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He ever lives above, for me to intercede;<br/>His all-redeeming love, His precious blood to plead:<br/>His blood atoned for all our race,<br/>His blood atoned for all our race,<br/>And sprinkles now the throne of grace.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Five bleeding wounds He bears, received on Calvary;<br/>They pour effectual prayers; they strongly plead for me:<br/>Forgive him, oh, forgive, they cry,<br/>Forgive him, oh, forgive, they cry,<br/>Nor let that ransomed sinner die!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>The Father hears Him pray, His dear anointed One;<br/>He cannot turn away the presence of His Son;<br/>His Spirit answers to the blood,<br/>His Spirit answers to the blood,<br/>And tells me I am born of God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>To God I'm reconciled; His pardâ€™ning voice I hear;<br/>He owns me for His child; I can no longer fear:<br/>With confidence I now draw nigh,<br/>With confidence I now draw nigh,<br/>And Father, Abba, Father, cry.</lines>
    </verse>
