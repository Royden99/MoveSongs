    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Touch the hem of His garment,<br/>Let Jesus make you whole,<br/>Touch the hem of His garment,<br/>Let His healing virtue flow;<br/>Lift your hands, you can reach Him,<br/>If you'll only be so bold;<br/>Touch the hem of His garment,<br/>And He will make you whole.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>A woman ill for many years<br/>Followed Jesus as He went;<br/>Physicians had tried but never helped<br/>And her money was now spent;<br/>But she reached toward the Son of God,<br/>And faith rose in her soul;<br/>She touched the hem of His garment,<br/>And Jesus made her whole.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>My friend, if it's been many years<br/>That you've followed on behind,<br/>Trying every other help<br/>Except His touch divine,<br/>But still your illness lingers on,<br/>In body or in soul,<br/>Touch the hem of His garment,<br/>And He will make you whole.<br/></lines>
