    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We want to see Jesus lifted high,<br/>A banner that flies across this land,<br/>That all men might see the truth and know<br/>He is the way to heaven.<br/>(REPEAT)</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>We want to see, We want to see,<br/>We want to see Jesus lifted high.<br/>We want to see, we want to see,<br/>We want to see Jesus lifted high.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Step by step we're moving forward,<br/>Little by little taking ground,<br/>Every prayer a powerful weapon,<br/>Strongholds come tumbling down,<br/>And down, and down, and down.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>We're gonna see, we're gonna see,<br/>We're gonna see Jesus lifted high.<br/>We're gonna see, we're gonna see,<br/>We're gonna see Jesus lifted high.<br/></lines>
