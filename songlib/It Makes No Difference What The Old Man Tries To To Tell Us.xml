      <lines>No matter what the devil may throw at us;<br/>We're Sons of God, and that's the way it is.<br/>We're in this world but brother we're not of it;<br/>We're Sons of God, and that's the way it is.<br/>No matter how the fire may surround us;<br/>We're Sons of God, and that's the way it is.<br/>We're in the fire, but, brother, it can't harm us;<br/>We're Sons of God, and that's the way it is.</lines>
