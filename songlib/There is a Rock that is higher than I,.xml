    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There is a Rock that is higher than I,<br/>The safest place I can run to.<br/>When the storm is raging around,<br/>There is no greater refuge.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>There is no Rock like our God,<br/>Thereâ€™s no surer foundation.<br/>There is no Rock like our God,<br/>No other way to salvation.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>For some You are the rock of offence,<br/>For me You are a stronghold.<br/>Some turn to others for strength,<br/>But I have found out for certain.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>So I will stand and hide myself,<br/>In the secret place of the Rock.<br/>And I will find my security,<br/>In the Rock that is higher than I.<br/></lines>
