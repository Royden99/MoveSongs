    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Glory, glory, hallelujah since I've been born again.<br/>I've received the revelation of how I can conquer sin.<br/>I don't have to live in bondage to the devil anymore.<br/>I'll walk perfect in His likeness as His Body is restored.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I'm on the road to glory I can see the world below.<br/>I know I'm getting stronger I can feel it in my soul.<br/>I believe the Word I'm hearing cause I know it's from the Lord.<br/>I'll walk perfect in His likeness as His Body is restored.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Don't you see the City spotless and restored in full array.<br/>Each golden bar tall and erect standing in it's place.<br/>Joined by the golden bars of truth His nature to proclaim.<br/>Walk on into the land, walk on His creation to reclaim.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>The visions' getting stronger: I can see it more each day.<br/>The glory's getting brighter as the incense burns away.<br/>I'm going on. I'm going on. No one can stop me now.<br/>His nature's coming forth in me.<br/>Through your love and His power.</lines>
    </verse>
