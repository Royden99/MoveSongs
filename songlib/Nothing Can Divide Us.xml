    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When I am afraid, I call upon the Lord.<br/>When I'm in distress, I call upon His holy name.<br/>He hears my faintest cry. He feels my every pain.<br/>He knows just what I am, and yet,<br/>He loves me just the same.<br/>Nothing; nothing; nothing.<br/>Oh nothing can divide us from His love, from His love.<br/>Oh nothing can divide us from his love.</lines>
