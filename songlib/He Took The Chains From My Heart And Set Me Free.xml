    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He took the chains from my heart, and He set me free,<br/>He gives me joy; now I'm happy as can be;<br/>He took me out of Satan's hand,<br/>Set my feet on higher ground,<br/>He took the chains from my heart, and He set me free.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He took the chains from my feet, and He set me free,<br/>He gives me peace; now I walk in liberty;<br/>He took me out of Satan's hand,<br/>Set my feet on higher ground,<br/>He took the chains from my feet, and He set me free.<br/></lines>
