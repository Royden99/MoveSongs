    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The splendour of a King, clothed in majesty,<br/>Let all the earth rejoice, all the earth rejoice;<br/>He wraps Himself in light, and darkness tries to hide<br/>And trembles at His voice, trembles at His voice.<br/>How great is our God, sing with me,<br/>How great is our God, and all will see<br/>How great, how great is our God.<br/>Age to age He stands, and time is in His hands,<br/>Beginning and the end, beginning and the end;<br/>The Godhead, Three in One; Father, Spirit, Son,<br/>The Lion and the Lamb, Lion and the Lamb.<br/>You're the Name above all names,<br/>You are worthy of all praise,<br/>And my heart will sing how great is our God.<br/></lines>
