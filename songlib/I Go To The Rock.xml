    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Where do I go when there's nobody else to turn to?<br/>Who do I talk to when nobody wants to listen?<br/>Who do I lean on when there is no foundation stable?<br/>I go to the Rock; I know He's able.<br/>I go to the Rock.<br/>Chorus:<br/>I go to the Rock of my salvation.<br/>I go to the Stone that the builders rejected.<br/>I run to the Mountain,<br/>And the Mountain stands by me.<br/>The earth all around me is sinking sand;<br/>On Christ the solid Rock I stand.<br/>When I need a shelter,<br/>When I need a friend,<br/>I go to the Rock.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Where do I go when the storms of life are threatening?<br/>Who do I turn to when those winds of sorrow blow?<br/>Is there a refuge in the time of tribulation?<br/>I go to the Rock; I know He's able.<br/>I go to the Rock.</lines>
