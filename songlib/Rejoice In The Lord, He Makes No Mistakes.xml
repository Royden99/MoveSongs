    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>God never moves without purpose or plan<br/>When trying His servant or molding a man.<br/>Give thanks to the Lord though your testing seems long<br/>In darkness He giveth a song.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>Oh, rejoice in the Lord<br/>He makes no mistake<br/>He knoweth the end of each path that I take<br/>For when I am tried and purified<br/>I shall come forth as gold.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I could not see through the shadows ahead<br/>So I looked at the cross of my Savior instead.<br/>I bowed to the will of the Master that day<br/>Then peace came and tears fled away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Now, I can see testing comes from above<br/>God strengthens His children and purges in love.<br/>My Father knows best and I trust in His care<br/>Through purging, more fruit I will bear.</lines>
