    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>God of creation, There at the start<br/>Before the beginning of time<br/>With no point of reference, You spoke to the dark<br/>And fleshed out the wonder of light</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And as You speak<br/>A hundred billion galaxies are born<br/>In the vapor of Your breath the planets form<br/>If the stars were made to worship so will I<br/>I can see Your heart in everything You’ve made<br/>Every burning star, A signal fire of grace<br/>If creation sings Your praises so will I</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>God of Your promise, You don’t speak in vain<br/>No syllable empty or void<br/>For once You have spoken, All nature and science<br/>Follow the sound of Your voice</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>And as You speak<br/>A hundred billion creatures catch Your breath<br/>Evolving in pursuit of what You said<br/>If it all reveals Your nature so will I<br/>I can see Your heart in everything You say<br/>Every painted sky, A canvas of Your grace<br/>If creation still obeys You so will I</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>If the stars were made to worship so will I<br/>If the mountains bow in reverence so will I<br/>If the oceans roar Your greatness so will I<br/>For if everything exists to lift You high so will I<br/>If the wind goes where You send it so will I<br/>If the rocks cry out in silence so will I<br/>If the sum of all our praises still falls shy<br/>Then we’ll sing again a hundred billion times<br/>God of salvation<br/>You chased down my heart<br/>Through all of my failure and pride<br/>On a hill You created<br/>The light of the world<br/>Abandoned in darkness to die<br/>And as You speak<br/>A hundred billion failures disappear<br/>Where You lost Your life so I could find it here<br/>If You left the grave behind You so will I<br/>I can see Your heart in everything You’ve done<br/>Every part designed in a work of art called love<br/>If You gladly chose surrender so will I<br/>I can see Your heart<br/>Eight billion different ways<br/>Every precious one<br/>A child You died to save<br/>If You gave Your life to love them so will I<br/>Like You would again a hundred billion times<br/>But what measure could amount to Your desire<br/>You’re the One who never leaves the one behind</lines>
