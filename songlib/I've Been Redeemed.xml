    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I've been redeemed. I've been redeemed.<br/>I've been redeemed. I've been redeemed.<br/>I've been washed in the blood of the Lamb,<br/>I've been washed in the blood of the Lamb,<br/>I've been washed in the blood of the Lamb,<br/>That flows from Calvary.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I've been set free. (4x)<br/>I've been purged in the fire of His love, (3x)<br/>That burns away my flesh.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I've been transformed. (4x)<br/>And I'm changed to the image of His Son, (3x)<br/>As Christ comes forth in me.</lines>
