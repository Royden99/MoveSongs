    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I stand amazed in the presence<br/>Of Jesus the Nazarene,<br/>And wonder how He could love me:<br/>A sinner, condemned, unclean.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>How marvellous! How wonderful!<br/>And my song shall ever be:<br/>How marvellous! How wonderful!<br/>Is my Saviour's love for me!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>For me it was in the garden<br/>He prayed, "Not my will, but Thine";<br/>He had no tears for His own griefs,<br/>But sweat drops of blood for mine.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>In pity angels beheld Him<br/>And came from the world of light<br/>To comfort Him in the sorrows<br/>He bore for my soul that night.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>He took my sins and my sorrows,<br/>He made them His very own,<br/>He bore the burden to Calvary,<br/>And suffered and died alone.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>When with the ransomed in glory<br/>His face I at last shall see,<br/>'Twill be my joy through the ages<br/>To sing of His love for me.<br/></lines>
