    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>And they sang as it were a new song<br/>Before the throne, the throne of God.<br/>And they sang as it were a new song<br/>Before the throne of the living God.<br/>And no man can learn that new song<br/>But the redeemed from the earth,<br/>And no man can learn that new song<br/>But the redeemed from the earth.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>These are they which were not defiled with women,<br/>For the are known as virgins,<br/>These are they which follow the Lamb wherever He goeth,<br/>They are the firstfruits unto God and unto the Lamb.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>These are they which were redeemed from among men,<br/>And in their mouth was found no guile.<br/>For they are without fault before the throne of God;<br/>They are the firstfruits unto God and unto the Lamb.</lines>
